# We want bleach[css] which includes tinycss2 as a dep, but bleach and
# weasyprint end up conflicting in which version. bleach[css] says tinycss2<1.3
# and weasyprint wants tinycss2>=1.3.0. It doesn't look like tinycss2 1.3.0 is
# actually a problem for bleach so currently letting weasyprint pick the dep
# because otherwise weasyprint is held back at a version that is broken the
# latest pydyf versions because of a breaking change in a point version
