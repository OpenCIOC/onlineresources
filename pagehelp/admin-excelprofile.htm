<p><strong><em>Excel Profiles</em></strong> allow you to configure profiles customizing output formats optimized for use in Microsoft Excel and similar programs. Excel Profiles offer the most varied options for outputting data, with a combination of data components usually only available in your Microsoft Access download and also all types of fields that can be used for the Record Details and pages. While Excel Profiles offer more options in terms of what can be exported, they do not provide any structure to the information and so tend to be less useful than <em>Export Profiles</em> as a means for using your data in other systems (and cannot be used to exchange data between CIOC databases).</p>
<p>Although they are distinct from <em>Export Profiles</em>, Excel output files are created via the export screens. The files that are created are of either an HTML or CSV format (chosen at the time of export) that should be importable by most spreadsheet programs.</p>
<h3>Edit an Existing Excel Profile</h3>
<p>To view or edit the settings of an existing Excel Profile, select the profile from the list and click <em>&quot;View / Edit Profile&quot;</em></p>
<h3>Add New Excel Profile</h3>
<p>To create a new Excel Profile, you must specify a unique name for the Profile. If you have existing Profiles, you can copy a profile by selecting it from the copy Profile list. If you do not select a Profile to copy, your new Profile will have default settings and no fields added. Click the <em>&quot;Add Profile&quot;</em> button to create the new Profile; you will be taken to the form to edit your new profile.</p>
