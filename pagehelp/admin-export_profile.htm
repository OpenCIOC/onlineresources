<p><strong><em>Export Profiles</em></strong> allow you to configure profiles customizing export formats for using data in other systems. This includes the <em>CIOC Sharing Format</em> that allows you to share records to other CIOC databases. Export Profiles allow you to define which fields, Distribution and Publication Codes that you want to share and specify which View(s) the export profile will be available in.</p>
<p>Note that <em>Excel Profiles</em> are managed separately. Excel Profiles offer more options in terms of what can be exported, but do not provide any structure to the information and so tend to be less useful as a means for using your data in other systems (and cannot be used to exchange data between CIOC databases).</p>
<h3>Edit an Existing Export Profile</h3>
<p>To view or edit the settings of an existing Export Profile, select the profile from the list and click <em>&quot;View / Edit Profile&quot;</em></p>
<h3>Add New Export Profile</h3>
<p>To create a new Export Profile, you must specify a unique name for the Profile. If you have existing Profiles, you can copy a profile by selecting it from the copy Profile list. If you do not select a Profile to copy, your new Profile will have default settings and no fields added. Click the <em>&quot;Add Profile&quot;</em> button to create the new Profile; you will be taken to the form to edit your new profile.</p>
