<p>The <strong><em>Manage Communities</em></strong> page allows you to add a new Community to the database or edit an existing Community. You may also upload a new file from the <a href="http://community-repository.cioc.ca" target="_blank">Communities Repository</a> to update your entire list.</p>
<p>There are two types of communities:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Standard Hierarchy Communities</strong> - each of these communities has exactly one parent.</li>
	<li><strong>Alternative Search Areas</strong> - these provide a way to have areas that do not fit into the hierarchy, for example because they cross boundaries or group a number of regions together for a special designation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Add a New Community</h3>
<p>New Communities or Alternative Search Areas can be created by clicking on the appropriate links at the top of the page.</p>
<p>CIOC software generally ships with an existing set of <em>&quot;Authorized&quot;</em> community values, based on the values in the CIOC Communities Repository. Any new communities created by users will be marked as <em>&quot;Local&quot;</em>; local terms in the drop-down are designated with a *.</p>
<h3>Edit an Existing Community</h3>
<p>Select the name of the Community you wish to edit from the drop-down menu and click the <em>&quot;View/Edit Community&quot;</em> button.</p>
<h3>Update Communities Version</h3>
<p>If you wish to update your values with a file from the CIOC Communities Repository, use this link to load in an updated file.</p>
