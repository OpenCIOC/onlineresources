<p>The <em>&quot;Manage Deleted Records&quot;</em> page displays a table containing all records that have been <em>marked</em> for deletion in the database. Records with a deletion date in the past will not appear in regular searches, while records with a deletion date in the future (&quot;pending deletion&quot;) are still available. Deleted records may be available through Advanced Search if deleted records are visible in the current View.</p>
<p>A record which is <em>marked</em> deleted (has a deletion date) continues to retain all its information, classifications, and relationships unless they are intentionally removed. In the case of Community Information records, the deleted records also continue to hold on to their Agency record number, making the numbers unavailable for reuse by new records.</p>
<p>From this page, those with record deletion privileges can change the deletion date or restore the record (removing its deleted or pending deleted status). Super Users also have the ability to permanently delete a record or group of records.</p>
<p>Permanently deleted records are irrevocably removed from the database and will no longer be viewable by anyone. Because removing records can affect statistical reports and other information, it is generally inadvisable to permanently delete records. If records must be deleted, the best time to do so would be after a purge of statistics, as might be done at year-end. If the record has been deleted for a sufficiently long time, it will have few to no current statistics and can be safely removed without causing anomalies in reports. Once a record has been permanently deleted, its Agency record number will be made available for reuse. <span class="Alert">Permanent deletion can only be performed by Super User type accounts.</span></p>
<h3>Bulk Permanent Deletion</h3>
<p>To permanently remove a large group of records, you can check the boxes next to the record or use the &quot;Check All&quot; button to select all available records. Click the &quot;Permanently delete selected records&quot; button to permanently remove all selected records. If there is no checkbox next to a record, it cannot be deleted, generally because it is still in use within the database (such as a Community Information record that is still in use by a Volunteer Opportunity). You must first remove references to the record before it can be deleted.</p>
<p>Please use this feature with extreme caution, since the records cannot be recovered once removed. If you plan to delete a set of records at once, it is strongly advisable to first export these records using a complete <em>CIOC Sharing Format</em> profile which will give you the opportunity to reinstate the records if a mistake is made. Because the Volunteer Opportunity Module does not currently support an import/export tool, saving a copy of the record details page(s) or keeping a Microsoft Access database archive may be appropriate instead.</p>
<h3>Records that Cannot be Permanently Deleted</h3>
<p>A legend at the top of the page indicates reasons why records may not be permanently deleted, and the letter that will appear next to each record if it applies to that record. The letter will appear in the far left column of the table.</p>
