<p>Each Taxonomy Term can be associated with a <em>Facet</em> which is meant to represent different types or categories of Terms. Examples of <em>Facets</em> include: &quot;Service&quot;, &quot;Target&quot;, and &quot;Organization/Facility Type&quot;. A <em>Facet</em> does not indicate anything about the specific kind of service, population, or format of delivery, but rather the broad idea of whether the Term describes some kind of service, population, or format of delivery, and so on. For more information about <em>Facets</em> and other structures of the Taxonomy, you should use an official reference such as the library on <a href="http://www.211taxonomy.org">211taxonomy.org</a>.</p>
