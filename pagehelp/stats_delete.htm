<p><span class="Alert">Note:</span> You may find the <a href="pagehelp?Page=stats.asp&Ln=en-CA">page help for the main statistics search form</a> useful for a general overview of the different types of statistics that are kept for your CIOC database and how to use of them appropriately.</p>
<hr>
<p>It is recommended that you periodically clear the database of old Record View Statistics that you do not require anymore, particularly if you work in a database that has high traffic (i.e. more than 250,000 record views per month). You should select an appropriate cut-off date for removing old statistics, such as your previous year-end for reporting to funders. <span class="Alert">Note that, as part of your membership commitment with CIOC, you must keep a minimum of 6 months statistics at all times; this information is used for the calculation of membership fees.</span></p>
<h3>Before Deleting</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Make sure you have a full backup/download</strong> of both your statistics and data (these are kept in separate files). Having a full data backup will allow you to reproduce statistical reports offline if it were required.</li>
	<li><strong>Consult any and all data partners</strong> and confirm the plan to remove old statistics. Statistics removal is not confined to any particular View or Agency, it will remove <strong>all</strong> statistics in the given module up to the period of the selected date.</li>
	<li><strong>Save and/or print</strong> any statistical reports you think you might want for the time segment you are deleting.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Deleting the Statistics</h3>
<p>On this page there is a table with two columns; the column on the left is the &quot;Delete Up To and Including&quot; column, with dates and radio buttons for selecting a date. The column on the right lists the number of statistics that would be deleted if you select that particular date.</p>
<p>To delete stats, click in the radio button for the month that you want to select. This will delete all stats for the selected month, <em>and everything prior to that month</em>. So if you selected March 2009, then all stats that occurred during or before March 2009 would be permanently deleted.</p>
<p>Important Note: once statistics have been deleted, they are permanently deleted and can not be restored without a backup and the assistance of a system administrator (at your cost). It is a good idea to keep a backup of your daily download, so that if you ever want to refer to older statistics you will have them in your download file.</p>
