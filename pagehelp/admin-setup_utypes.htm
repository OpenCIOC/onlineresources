<p><strong><em>User Types</em></strong> represent the security restrictions for the user, dictating which information the user will be able to access and what changes (if any) they will be able to make to that information. Selecting a <em>User Type</em> will determine which View the user sees when they log in and what permissions they have to change data, export records, make setup change, etc. User Types are set individually for each module of the database (Community Information and Volunteer).</p>
<p>The <em>Manage User Types</em> page allows you to create or edit different User Types, which can then be assigned to Users. For example, you may decide to create different User Types for your database administrators, I&amp;R staff, volunteers, or a 3rd party partner who has a specialized <em>View</em>.</p>
