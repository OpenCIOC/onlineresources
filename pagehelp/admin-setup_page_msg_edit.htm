<p>A <strong><em>Page Message</em></strong> allows you to insert some information on a page to be displayed below the page header but before all other content. A <em>Page Message</em> appears only on the specific pages and <em>Views</em> you select, and only in the language specified. You can also choose whether the message will be available when viewing a page in <em>Print Mode</em>.</p>
<p>HTML is allowed and must be used if you wish to add formatting such as headings, paragraphs, etc. Page messages should be kept brief and are appropriately used for special instructions or announcements where the information needs to occur on some pages but not others. If a message needs to occur on every page, it may be more appropriately placed in the Template or View setup.</p>
