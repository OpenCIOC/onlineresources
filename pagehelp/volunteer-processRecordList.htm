<h4>New Reminder</h4>
<p>The Reminders system is intended to assist users in creating task lists for themselves and other users, as well as provide a means of communicating information to other CIOC users. Reminders can be for general tasks or communications, or they may be tied to one or more records. You can work with reminders by clicking the Reminders link in your site bar, or (in the case of Reminders tied to specific records), through the Record Details page. You can also create a reminder for a group of records through your search results. Click the &quot;Next&quot; button to begin creating a new reminder for the selected records.</p>
