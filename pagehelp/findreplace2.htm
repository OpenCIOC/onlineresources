<p>In <span class="Alert">Alert colour</span> text on this page, you will be notified of how many records were altered. Pay careful attention to this. If the number indicated does not match the number of records you attempted to perform the function on, then one or more records of the records were not modified in the operation. This could occur, for example, if you your <em>Find and Replace</em> operation is looking for the word <em>&quot;information&quot;</em> in 10 records but it only appears in 8 of them.</p>
<p>From this page you can <em>Return to Previous Search Results</em>, which returns the results of the last search you performed before the Find and Replace operation; The <em>List of Altered Records</em> link (if available) displays the records impacted by the Find and Replace operation; The <em>Original List of Records for Find/Replace</em> link will display a list of the records you selected to perform the Find and Replace operation on.</p>
<p><span class="Alert">Important Note</span>: the <em>Find and Replace</em> tool cannot perform validation on any of the modifications you make to your data through this tool. Please use <em>Find and Replace</em> with extreme caution and save the Find and Replace report for future reference in case you discover a problem with your modifications.
