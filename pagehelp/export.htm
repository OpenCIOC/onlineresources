<p>From this page you can export chosen records from the database in three formats, depending on your permissions:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Microsoft Saved Recordset (XML)</strong> - uses Microsoft's XML recordset format; a tool is available for CIOC members to convert this format into a Microsoft Access table (reference available on the <a href="http://community.cioc.ca/resources/how-to/xml-export-to-access">CIOC Community site</a>).</li>
	<li><strong>CIOC Sharing Format (XML)</strong> - works with the CIOC Import Tool. <span class="Alert">Note</span>: to share records with other CIOC users, their CIOC software version must support a compatible version of the CIOC Sharing Format. If the partner you are working with uses a newer or older version of CIOC, or 3rd party software, your export may not be compatible.</li>
	<li><strong>Excel Spreadsheet</strong> - formats compatible with various versions of Microsoft Excel and/or other spreadsheet programs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Choose the format you wish to export in. Depending on your permissions, you may be given the option to restrict your export based on a set of codes (e.g. Publication, Distribution, or Category). Choose one or more codes from any <strong>one</strong> list of codes to include in the export and then click the &quot;Next&quot; button. You choose multiple codes by holding your &quot;Ctrl&quot; button down while making selections from the list.</p>
<h3>Export Profiles / Excel Profiles</h3>
<p>Export and Excel Profiles allow you to specify specific fields to export. You must specify a Profile to use from those available to you. Note that Profiles are made available on a per-View basis; edit the list of Views for each Profile on the Profile setup page.</p>
<h3>Generating the Export File</h3>
<p>Once you have made your selections, click &quot;Next&quot; to begin the export process. The file will be available on the server for a limited time only, so please download the file promptly. Only the person who generates the file may download it.</p>
