<p>The <em>Update Publications</em> page allows you to add a new publication code to a record in the database or edit / remove an existing publication code attached to a record. If you want to add, modify or delete a publication code used in the database, this needs to be accomplished from the <em>Publications</em> menu item accessible from the menu menu / basic search page. Actions performed on this page change only the chosen record.</p>
<p>What appears on this page will depend upon whether any publication codes are already attached to the record, and whether the attached publications have associated descriptions or general headings.</p>
<p class="Alert">Note that your current View settings limit the Publications you are permitted to work with - you can only see, add or remove Publications that are available in the current View.</p>
<p>The table on this page has six columns:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Code:</strong> Any publication codes already attached to this record will appear in this column.</li>
	<li><strong>Name:</strong> The &quot;friendly&quot; name for this Publication, if one exists.</li>
	<li><strong>Has Description:</strong> If a Publication has an associated <em>Publication Description</em> for this record, three asterisks (***) will appear in this column.</li>
	<li><strong>Has Headings:</strong> If a Publication has an associated <em>General Heading</em> for this record, three asterisks (***) will appear in this column.</li>
	<li><strong>Has Feedback:</strong> If this record contains <em>Publication Feedback</em> three asterisks (***) will appear in this column.</li>
	<li><strong>Action:</strong> If there are no publication codes yet attached to this record, there will only be an <em>Add</em> button available. Beside each Publication Code already associated with this record will be <em>Update</em> and <em>Delete</em> buttons. Click on the <em>Update</em> button to move to a new screen where you can edit / add a publication description or modify the General Headings associated with this record. The <em>Delete</em> button allows you to remove a Publication Code (and any associated publication description and general headings) from a record. Clicking delete will take you to a new screen where you need to confirm your decision to remove the Publication Code from the record. To add a new Publication Code to the record, select the desired value from the drop-down list and click the <em>Add</em> Button</li>
