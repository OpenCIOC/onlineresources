<h3>Search by Keyword</h3>
<p>In general, the Taxonomy Term <em>Keyword</em> search can be expected to behave like the CIOC keyword search from the basic search form. All words or phrases entered must be matched, and some reserved or very common words - like <em>&quot;and&quot;</em> and <em>&quot;or&quot;</em>, will be automatically ignored. You can search for a phrase by enclosing the desired words in quotation marks. Character accents are automatically ignored by the software and are not required for your search in order to get a match, even when searching in French.</p>
<p>The software automatically searches many different word forms for the current language. For instance, typing in <em>library</em> or <em>libraries</em> produces the same result, so either can be used. You can explicitly prevent the searching of word forms by using quotation marks around the word of phrase. You can also add the wildcard character <strong>*</strong> to the <em>beginning</em> or <em>end</em> of a word in your search to allow a partial word match (e.g. <em>dog*</em> would match <em>dog, dogs, dogma, dogged</em>, etc; <em>*bus*</em> would match <em>bus, abuse, bust, business</em>, etc. In many cases, allowing the software to use its built-in ability to search word forms is more effective than using the asterisk for simple variations of the same word (child and children, help and helping). This is because it reduces the number of unwanted extra matches, such as <em>scan*</em> matching <em>scant</em> and <em>scandal</em> when what was intended was just matching <em>scan</em>, <em>scans</em>, and <em>scanning</em>.</p>
<p><em>Keyword</em> search allows you to look for keywords within the Term's <em>Name</em> (or the <em>Alternate Name</em>) and - if you choose the <em>Anywhere</em> option - it will also search in the Term's <em>Definition</em> or <em>Alternate Definition</em>. <strong>All</strong> the Keywords you specify must appear in any <strong>one</strong> of the fields you are searching in. That means if you searched for the keywords <em>&quot;</em><em>abuse&quot;</em> and <em>&quot;neglect&quot;</em> using the <em>Anywhere</em> search option, it would have to find both of those words either in the <em>Name/Alternate Name</em> <strong>or</strong> the <em>Definition/Alternate Definition</em>. You would not get a match if <em>&quot;abuse&quot;</em> was in the <em>Name</em> and <em>&quot;neglect&quot;</em> was in the <em>Definition</em>.</p>

<a name="code"></a>
<h3>Search by Code</h3>
<p><em>Code</em> search allows you to list all Terms that belong to the branch of a given Taxonomy Code. You must enter a <strong>valid code</strong> to perform this search. That means if you searched for <em>TA-04</em> you would not get any matches; however, <em>TA-0400</em> would list <em>TA-0400</em> and all its child Terms, because it is a valid Code.</p>
<p>Often the <em>Drill-Down</em> search is a better option when you want to navigate branches of the Taxonomy hierarchy. However, unlike the <em>Drill-Down</em> search, a <em>Code</em> search will allow you to sort by name and display the entire branch at once without having to drill into it first. The <em>Code</em> search results is also where you would end up if you click on a Narrower, Broader or Related Term when <a href="#more-info"><em>Displaying More Term Information</em></a>.</p>

<a name="drill-down"></a>
<h3>Drill-Down Search</h3>
<p>The <em>Drill-Down</em> search allows you to navigate one or more branches of the Taxonomy hierarchy. It has similar features to the other searches, but you cannot sort your search. Unlike other search types, changing your settings or leaving the page will always reset the search and all branches will close (See <a href="#back-button"><em>Effects of Using the Back Button</em></a>).</p>
<p>To expand a branch of the hierarchy, click on the plus sign (<img src="../images/plus.gif" width="14" height="14">) which will be available next to any branch that can be expanded. The next level of terms will be automatically retrieved for you and the branch will expand, and the plus sign will turn into a minus sign (<img src="../images/minus.gif" width="14" height="14">). Note that you should <strong>wait for the branch to open</strong>, which could take a little while if there are many Terms to display. If a minus sign has appeared after clicking, it means that your browser is waiting for the Terms to be sent and will display them when they are ready. If you click on the minus sign, you are making a request to close the branch again and your terms may not appear at all.</p>

<h3>Related Concept Search</h3>
<p>To view a list of Terms associated with a <em>Related Concept</em>, select a Concept to display and click <em>Search</em>.</p>

<a name="more-info"></a>
<h3>Displaying More Term Information</h3>
<p>When viewing a list of Taxonomy Terms returned from one of the above types of searches, you can View more detailed information about the Term by clicking on the name of the Term. The Term's <em>Definition</em> (or Alternate Definition) will be displayed as well as any associated <em>Related Concepts</em> and the <em>Broader Term</em>, <em>Sub-Topics</em>, or <em>Related Topics</em> for the Term. Concepts will be linked to a <a href="#concept"><em>Related Concept Search</em></a>, while any associated Terms will display a count of the number of records using the Term and be linked to a <a href="#code"><em>Code Search</em></a> for that Term. Super Users will see additional Data Management fields.</p>
<p>You can display additional Term information for any number of Terms in your search results simultaneously. To hide the extra information, click again on the name of the Term.</p>

<p align="center">[ <a href="#top" style="text-decoration:none">Top</a> ]</p>

<a name="sort"></a>
<h3>Changing the Sort Order</h3>
<p>The sort order of your search results can be changed for all types of searches except the <em>Drill-Down</em> search. The initial sort order varies depending on the type of search you perform; for example the <em>Keyword</em> search sorts by Name by default while the <em>Code</em> search will initially sort by Code. Note that the sort order is not remembered between searches.</p>
<p>Your current sort order is denoted by an arrow next to the column name (<img src="../images/up.gif" width="14" height="14"> or <img src="../images/down.gif" width="14" height="14">). The arrow indicates which column is being sorted and whether the sort is <em>Ascending</em> or <em>Descending</em>. To change the sort to a different column, or change the direction of the sort on the existing sorted column, click on the column's name in the table header and your results will be resorted. Changing the sort order may close some or all of the <a href="#more-info"><em>More Information</em></a> boxes you have open.</p>

<a name="settings"></a>
<h3>Search Settings</h3>
<p>Search settings from the search menu last only until you leave the Basic Search page (this includes going to <em>Manage Taxonomy</em>). If you turn on one of these menu-based search settings, it will be highlighted to remind you that it is active.</p>
<p>Note that changing your settings will reset or redisplay your current search results. In the case of a Drill-down search, you will have to re-open the branch(es) you were displaying when you changed your settings.</p>

<h4>Terms with Records / Show All Terms</h4>
<p>You can choose to display all Terms (the default) or only those that are attached to records in your current View. If you have elected to show only terms with records, the menu option will change to say <em>Show All Terms</em> and will be highlighted. If you are having trouble finding an appropriate Term, check that you are showing all Terms; even if there are no records associated with the Term, you may be able to use the <a href="#more-info"><em>More Term Information</em></a> feature to find related or narrower Terms that do have records.</p>

<h4>Show / Hide Inactive Terms</h4>
<p>You can choose to include Inactive Terms and Use References in your search by turning on the <em>Show Inactive Terms</em> option. This option is not available to Super Users in the Basic Search; they have the option to search in <em>Admin Mode</em> instead.</p>
<h4>Admin Mode / Normal Mode</h4>
<p><em>Admin Mode</em> is available in lieu of <em>Show Inactive Terms</em> for Super Users from the Basic Search. Admin Mode offers the following features:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Inactive Terms and Use References are available in all searches; however unlike the regular <em>Show Inactive Terms</em>, Admin Mode also includes Inactive Terms that are <em>Rolled-Up</em> into Use References for higher-level Active Terms. When Viewing <a href="#more-info"><em>More Term Information</em></a>, Use References that represent <em>Rolled-Up Terms</em> are linked so that they can be viewed and edited.</li>
	<li>Keyword Search results include all possible matches, including Active and Inactive Use References and Rolled-Up Terms, even if the Preferred Term also matches the search parameters.</li>
	<li>Edit Icons appear next to Terms.</li>
</ul>

<a name="back-button"></a>
<h3>Effects of Using the Back Button</h3>
<p>Some features of this search use JavaScript to change your display without having to reload the page. Examples of this will be the display of <a href="#more-info"><em>More Term Information</em></a> box, opening branches of a <a href="#drill-down"><em>Drill-Down search</em></a>, or <a href="#sort"><em>changing your sort order</em></a>.</p>
<p>This means that use of the browser's back button after leaving the page (for example after leaving the page to perform a record search, edit a term, or going to a different search option) may mean that you are unable to return to the same state of your search results if you leave the page and then use the back button to return. In addition, the back button will not undo the types of actions mentioned above that are controlled by JavaScript. Use the methods explained in this help file if you want to change back your sort order, close the <em>More Term Information</em> box, or close a branch of the hierarchy in a <em>Drill-Down</em> search - the back button will not work to do this!</p>
<p>Do not rely on the browser's back button - get in the habit of always using the available menu items to do your searching and navigate the site.</p>

<a name="search"></a>
<h3>Select a Term to Search</h3>
<p>If there are records associated with a Term or any of its Sub-Topics in this View, a magnifying glass icon will appear next to the Term (<img src="../images/zoom.gif" width="17" height="14">). Clicking on this icon will perform a record search for the Term <strong>and</strong> all its Sub-Topics.</p>
<p>If the Term is being directly used by records in this View, there will be a record count next to the Term name in square brackets indicating the number of records using the Term in this View: [#]. Clicking on the record count will perform a search for all records that directly use this Term - it <strong>does not</strong> include any Sub-Topics.</p>

<p align="center">[ <a href="#top" style="text-decoration:none">Top</a> ]</p>
<hr>

<a name="edit"></a>
<h3>Select a Term to Edit</h3>
<p>Super Users will see an edit icon next to each Term name (<img src="../images/edit.gif" width="15" height="14">) when in <em>Admin Mode</em>. Clicking on the edit icon will take you to a form to edit the details for the given Term.</p>
