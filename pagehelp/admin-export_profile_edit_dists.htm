<p>The <em>Manage Export Distribution Codes</em> page allows you to select which Distribution codes will be included in the <em>Distribution</em> field of the records you export. Check or uncheck the boxes next to the Distribution codes you want to include or exclude from this Export Profile, and click the <em>&quot;Submit&quot;</em> button at page bottom to save your changes.
