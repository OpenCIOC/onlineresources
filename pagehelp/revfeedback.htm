<p>The <em>&quot;Review Feedback&quot;</em> page displays information on feedback submitted for existing records, as well as any requests for new records that have been received. The feedback you are able to view will be determined by your permissions in the database. The three types of feedback are:</p>
<ol>
	<li><a href="#existing">Feedback on existing records</a></li>
	<li><a href="#new">New Record Suggestions</a></li>
	<li><a href="#pub">Publication Feedback</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Most types of feedback are also sub-divided between records <strong>owned by your Agency</strong>, those that are <strong>owned by another Agency</strong>, and those that are <strong>unassigned</strong> (new record suggestions only).</p>
<p><span class="Alert">Important Note</span>: Whenever feedback is deleted but not processed, the software does not notify the submitter - be sure to contact the submitter when appropriate and let them know why their suggestions were not processed.</p>

<h3>Feedback on Existing Records</h3>
<p>The <em>Feedback on Existing Records</em> tables display any incoming record change suggestions for records in the current View. These records can be sorted by any of the column headings (e.g. Record #, Organization Name(s), Date Submitted, etc.) by clicking on the desired column header. If there is no current feedback for records in this View, you will see the message: <em>&quot;There are 0 records with feedback&quot;</em>. Your own Agency's feedback will be listed first; any feedback from other Agencies will follow the list of <a href="#new"><em>New Record Suggestions</em></a>.</p>
<p>Depending on your permissions, you may have access to one or more of the following <em>Actions</em> on the feedback:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>View</strong> - View a read-only page containing all field changes and comments for the selected feedback.</li>
	<li><strong>Update</strong> - Go to the data entry form for the record associated with the selected feedback (allowing you to process the feedback).</li>
	<li><strong>Delete</strong> - Remove the feedback without processing it or updating the record. Useful if the feedback has no relevant record updates (an inquiry, spam, etc)</li>
</ul>
<a name="new"></a>
<h3>New Record Suggestions</h3>
<p>The <em>New Record Suggestions</em> table contains all new record suggestions, no matter which View they were submitted from. Any user with permissions to create new records will be able to create a new record based on the feedback. The table operates very similarly to <em>Feedback on Existing Records</em> above, but instead of updating an existing record you may have a link to <em>Create Record</em> to make a brand new record.</p>
<p>In general, a good first step in working with a new record suggestion should be assigning it to the appropriate Agency that will be responsible for creating and maintaining the record. The ability to assign feedback is determined by the settings in a user's User Type; note that only Super Users can re-assign suggestions that are currently assigned to an Agency other than their own. Assign a suggestion to an Agency by selecting the checkbox next to the record, selecting the Agency code from the drop-down, and clicking the <em>&quot;Submit&quot;</em> button. Users with record deletion privileges will have permission to delete a suggestion once the suggestions have been assigned to the user's Agency.</p>
<p><span class="Alert">A Few Important Notes...</span></p>
<ul>
	<li>Because there is no agency associated with a new record suggestion, there is no contact to send a notice of the suggestion. Therefore, it is important for each agency to check the new record suggestion list here on a regular basis.</li>
	<li>If you work in a multi-agency database, you should have official policies on how to handle new records to determine who is responsible for new record suggestions, when and why suggestions might be deleted and by whom, and what the notification process will be in that case.</li>
</ul>
<a name="pub"></a>
<h3>Publication Feedback</h3>
<p><em>Publication Feedback</em> is created at the same time as regular feedback, when some Publication-specific fields have been included on a feedback form. Publication feedback can only be submitted on records that belong to the publication(s) in question, and it is possible for a single feedback submission to generate multiple <em>Publication Feedback</em> entries. Each <em>Publication Feedback</em> must be processed individually, and independent of the regular record feedback. As with new record suggestions, it is <strong>important to have a policy</strong> on how this feedback should be processed, when and by whom.</p>
<p>The table operates very similarly to <em>Feedback on Existing Records</em> above, but instead of being taken to the <em>Update Record</em> form, you will be taken to the <em>Update Publication</em> form.</p>
