<p>The <strong><em>Add / Edit Design Templates</em></strong> pages allow changes to any previously created Template or the creation of a new Design Template. Design templates bring together various design elements (layouts, colours, styles) to help you to change the look of any View in your database.</p>
<p>If you are editing or copying an existing an existing template, the content of the existing template will be in the form fields; otherwise you will have a blank form with which to create a new Template.</p>
<p>The primary elements to include in the design of a template from this page:</p>
<ul>
	<li>external links to bring in logos, icons, style sheets (CSS), and JavaScript files</li>
	<li>copyright notice</li>
	<li>selection of fonts, colours, backgrounds etc.</li>
	<li>selection of a header and footer layout, and optional menu items for each</li>
	<li>selection of a search (main page) layout, and optional menu items</li>
</ul>
<p>The second half of the template setup - everything after the selection of layouts - refers to various jQuery UI elements. jQuery is a JavaScript library used extensively within CIOC Software, and jQuery UI is a complementary styling library. For more information on jQuery UI, visit <a href="http://jqueryui.com/" target="_blank">http://jqueryui.com/</a>.</p>
<p>More information on the creation/editing of templates can be found in the references (including training video) on the CIOC Community site, located at <a href="http://community.cioc.ca/" target="_blank">http://community.cioc.ca/</a>. Any questions or difficulties encountered while creating a template should be posted to the <a href="http://community.cioc.ca/message-board" target="_blank">CIOC Community Message Board</a> where other users or CIOC Help Desk staff will assist in resolution of specific questions or difficulties. Help with style sheets, custom html headers and footers, JavaScript, etc. can not be addressed within this help document and should be posted to the discussion board referenced above.</p>
