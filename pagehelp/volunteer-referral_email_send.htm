<p><em>For more information on Referral follow-up emails, view the help for the <a href="pagehelp?Page=volunteer%2Freferral_email_prep.asp&Ln=en-CA">Customize Referral Follow-Up Email</a> page.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>On this page, the software will attempt to send the Referral follow-up email messages(s) you have created. The software will report any known issues with sending the message(s) and print a report of the Email addresses referral summaries that were sent. For example:</p>
Email sent to: <strong>myaddy1@mysite.com</strong> (A. Volunteer)
<div style="margin-left: 4em;">Referral Date: 21 Dec 2006
<br>Position: Number One Position
<br>Organization: The Organization for helping people.
<br><br></div>
Email sent to: <strong>myaddy2@anothersite.ca</strong> (B. Volunteer)
<div style="margin-left: 4em;">Referral Date: 22 Dec 2006
<br>Position: Number Two Position
<br>Organization: The Organization for helping people.
<br><br></div>
<p>It is recommended that you print this page, as it provides you with the only record of emails successfully sent. <span class="Alert">Note</span>: it is still possible for an Email delivery to fail even though the system was able to create the Email message; you should receive an Email &quot;bounce-back&quot; message in this situation.</p>
