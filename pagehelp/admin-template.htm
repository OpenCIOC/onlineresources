<p><strong><em>Design Templates</em></strong> control the style / look of the database, including colours, logos, style sheets, headers and footers, etc.</p>
<p>Templates that are exclusively controlled by a particular Agency have that Agency Code at the end of the name in square brackets (i.e. [ABC]). You will be able to select Templates you don't own from the list for viewing, but will not be able to make changes to those Templates.</p>
<p>You will have one or more built-in system Templates in your database. You can view or copy these built-in Templates, and use them in your Views if desired, but they cannot be edited in any way. System Templates are denoted with a *.</p>
<h3>Edit an Existing Template</h3>
<p>Select the name of the template you wish to edit from the drop-down menu and click the <em>&quot;View / Edit Template&quot;</em> button.</p>
<h3>Add a New Template</h3>
<p>To create a new Template, click the <em>&quot;Add Template&quot;</em> button to be taken to a new template data entry form. If you have existing Templates, you can copy a Template by selecting it from the copy Template list. If you do not select a Template to copy, your new Template will have default settings.</p>
