<p><span class="Alert">Note:</span> You may find the <a href="pagehelp?Page=stats.asp&Ln=en-CA">page help for the main statistics search form</a> useful for a general overview of the different types of statistics that are kept for your CIOC database and how to use of them appropriately.</p>
<hr>
<p>This page displays a table showing the total record usage in the database, sorted by record owner, and the number or records per record owner. Both public and total usage is displayed (indicating both non-logged in and logged in users). In databases with more than one record owner, this will allow for a quick comparison of how records are being utilized across the database, based on record owners assigned.</p>
<p>Note that these values are based on the software's internal Record View Statistics; <span class="Alert">Record View Statistics are not kept when you change to print mode or temporarily change your View</span>, to avoid inflating statistics when a person is looking at multiple versions of the same record for the same purpose.</p>
<p>At the top of the page are links to several other statistical tools: <em>Main Stats Page</em>, <em>Total Record Use</em>, <em>Top 50 Records</em>, <em>Quick Reports</em>, and <em>Delete Old Statistics</em>.</p>
