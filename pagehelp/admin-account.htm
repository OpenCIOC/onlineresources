<p class="alert">The <em><strong>User Account</strong></em> page allows you to modify some settings related to the account information associated with your database login. Settings related to your permissions within the database (your <em>User Type</em>) can only be altered by another user with equivalent or higher security than yourself.</p>
<p>Settings you can change yourself may include your first and last name, your initials, your email address and your password for the database. If you do not have permission to change some or all of these settings, you may see a form for making a request to your local administrator to make these changes for you.</p>
<h3>Changing Your Password</h3>
<p>Please read the information regarding passwords on the page carefully. To change your password, you must first enter your existing password and then enter your new desired password in the two fields provided. Clicking update will commit the changes. You do not have to enter your password information unless you wish to change your password.</p>
<p>Use a <span class="Alert">secure password</span>, but not a password you use for other things. Your account and password information is not encrypted, so never use a password that you use for important accounts. Some recommendations for keeping a secure password:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Use <strong>at least 8</strong> characters</li>
	<li>Use both <strong>UPPER</strong> and <strong>lower</strong> case letters</li>
	<li>Use at least one <strong>number</strong> or <strong>symbol</strong></li>
	<li>Update your password on a regular schedule (every few months, for example)</li>
	<li>Never give your password to others</li>
</ul>
<p class="Alert">Remember your password.</p>
<p>If you forget your password, you will need to have it reset by a database Super User or other user with management privileges, depending on your security level. Ensure you know who to contact should you forget your password information. <strong>Please note that CIOC representatives cannot retrieve your password for you, and will not modify any account except under emergency circumstances with a direct request by the official membership contact.</strong></p>
<p><span class="alert">Note: Do <strong>not</strong> change your account password if you know that others are using the same login information to access the database, unless you have made prior arrangements to let them know the new password. Where possible, each person should have their own account for the database.</span></p>
