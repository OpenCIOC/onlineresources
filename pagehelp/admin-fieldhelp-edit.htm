<p>The <strong><em>Update Field Help</em></strong> page allows you to edit the field help that explains the content and data standards for each field. Field Help links appear next to each field on data entry forms, including adding / updating forms, and feedback forms including <em>&quot;Suggest New Record&quot;</em>. If help is available, a question mark image will appear next the field on the form which will open a pop-up window displaying the help: <img src="../images/help.gif" alt="Help Icon" width="17" height="17" border="0" align="texttop">.</p>
<p>A maximum of 8000 characters are allowed for each field help entry written. HTML must be used to show formatting like headings, paragraphs, etc. If help already exists for the field, the existing help will be shown, otherwise the text entry area will be blank. To view the current help for this field, click the <em>&quot;View the current help&quot;</em> link. Note that changes you make will not be reflected when you <em>&quot;View the current help&quot;</em> until you save them by clicking the <em>&quot;Submit Updates&quot;</em> button at the bottom of the form.</p>
<p><span class="Alert">Important Note</span>: Remember when writing these field help files that they will be visible to the public submitting feedback as well as to experienced logged in staff. Field help should be written in such a way that it can be understood by a public user with no experience working in the database, while still reflecting the standards for data entry that are important to database administrative staff.</p>
