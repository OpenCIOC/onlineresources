<h3>Create New Term</h3>
<p>To create a new Subject Term, click the <strong>Create new Subject Term</strong> link. You will be taken to a form to enter the term information.</p>
<h3>Manage Source Values</h3>
<p>Each Subject Term can be associated with a <em>Source</em> (i.e. &quot;InformOntario&quot;). To edit the available list of Source values, click the <strong>Manage Thesaurus Source Values</strong> link.</p>
<h3>Edit existing Term</h3>
To edit an existing Subject Term, use the Search form to locate the Term(s) you want to edit. If you do not enter any criteria default, the search form defaults to returning all <em>Active</em> Terms.
<h4>Keyword Search Tips</h4>
<p>You may search in the French or English Term names or Notes fields. The search form defaults to searching the English Term name.</p>
<p>You may choose to match <strong>All</strong> the Terms or phrases in your list, <strong>Any</strong> one of the terms or phrases, or you may use the <em>Boolean</em> option to create a custom search. Note that the system is unable to correct badly formed Boolean search phrases, and errors in a Boolean search will yield no results. When creating a Boolean search, all terms or phrases must be connected with &quot;and&quot;, &quot;or&quot;; you may also preference any term or phrase with the word &quot;not&quot;. Round Brackets may be used to group sets of terms or phrases together.</p>
<p>You may perform two simultaneous keyword searches of the Thesaurus. If you perform two keyword searches, you must specify how to join the two:</p>
<ul>
	<li><em>AND</em> - Both search criteria must match</li>
	<li><em>OR</em> - Either search criteria must match</li>
	<li><em>AND NOT</em> - The first criteria must match, <em>and</em> the second criteria must <em>not</em> match</li>
	<li><em>OR NOT</em> - The first criteria must match, <em>or</em> the second criteria must <em>not</em> match</li>
</ul>
<h4>Changing the Results Display</h4>
<p>At the bottom of the search form, you will see options for changing the display of your search results.</p>
<p>You may sort the list of terms by the <em>Name</em> of the Term (English or French, depending on your current display language), or by the <em>Last Modified</em> date of the term with most recently modified Terms appearing first.</p>
<p>By default, the results display will include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The Term name (in the current language)</li>
	<li>The preferred Term (if the term is <em>Unused</em>, which Term to use instead)</li>
	<li>The number of records using the subject (The count is for <em>All</em> records in the database, including those not in the current View)</li>
</ul>
<p>By selected <strong>Display Full Subject Information</strong>, you will see all available information about the subject including:</p>
<ul>
	<li><em>Broader</em>, <em>Narrower</em> and <em>Related</em> Terms</li>
	<li><em>Used For</em> information - where the given Term is a preferred Term for another, <em>Unused</em> Term.</li>
	<li>Data management information.</li>
</ul>
