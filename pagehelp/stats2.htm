<p><span class="Alert">Note:</span> You may find the <a href="pagehelp?Page=stats.asp&Ln=en-CA">page help for the main statistics search form</a> useful for a general overview of the different types of statistics that are kept for your CIOC database and how to use of them appropriately.</p>
<hr>
<p>This page provides a listing of all records in the database along with their public usage (non logged in users) and total usage (public and logged in users). The results are sorted alphabetically by the Organization name. If the record is available in your current View, you can view it by clicking on the link on the record number (Note: this link is not available when viewing your report in Print Mode).</p>
<p class="Alert">If you see an entry with no record information at the bottom of this table, this represents statistics that were associated with records that have since been permanently deleted from the database.</p>
<p>Note that these values are based on the software's internal Record View Statistics; <span class="Alert">Record View Statistics are not kept when you change to print mode or temporarily change your View</span>, to avoid inflating statistics when a person is looking at multiple versions of the same record for the same purpose.</p>
<p>At the top of the page are links to several other statistical tools: <em>Main Stats Page</em>, <em>Top 50 Records</em>, <em>Use By Agency</em>, <em>Quick Reports</em>, and <em>Delete Old Statistics</em>.</p>
