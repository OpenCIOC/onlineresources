<p>This page requests your confirmation before permanently removing record(s) from the database. Records marked with a green checkmark <img src="../images/greencheck.gif" /> are ready to delete.</p>
<p>Permanently deleted records are irrevocably removed from the database and will no longer be viewable by anyone. Because removing records can affect statistical reports and other information, it is generally inadvisable to permanently delete records. If records must be deleted, the best time to do so would be after a purge of statistics, as might be done at year-end. If the record has been deleted for a sufficiently long time, it will have few to no current statistics and can be safely removed without causing anomalies in reports. Once a record has been permanently deleted, its Agency record number will be made available for reuse.</p>
<p>If you are deleting a single record, you will be given a link to the <em>&quot;Record Details&quot;</em> page to review the record's contents before deleting it. If you plan to delete a set of records at once, it is strongly advisable to first export these records using a complete <em>CIOC Sharing Format</em> profile which will give you the opportunity to restore the records if a mistake is made.</p>
