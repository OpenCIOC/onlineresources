<p>The <em>More Info</em> page provides a report about the selected export file. It is recommended that you carefully review the <em>More Info</em> report <strong>before</strong> you run the import.</p>
<p>The report indicates the filename, friendly name, number of records to add or update, which language the records are available in, the Publication and/or Distribution Codes included, and the fields that will be updated. Note that only Publication, and/or Distribution Codes that existed in your database at the time the export file was loaded are included; you cannot import any of these code types without first adding them to your database through the Publication or Distribution setup.</p>
<p>It is important to make sure that the file includes the data you expect, so that you do not accidentally overwrite fields or codes where you wish to preserve your own data. You will have the opportunity to view data for individual records during the Add / Update process.</p>
