<p>The <strong><em>View Import Data</em></strong> page allows you to see the contents of each field for the given record, as they appear in the XML Export File that was uploaded. At the top of the page there is an indication of the record language(s) and record owner indicated in the export file.</p>
<p>Some fields, such as those with checklists or classification items, will be broken down into individual components. If more than one language is present in the file, data for each language will be displayed together. <strong>Pay special attention to blank fields</strong>, as this means that any existing data you have in that field in an existing version of the record will be erased. If you are importing a multilingual record, note where there may be data missing in one language (the data label will have the language in brackets, or explicitly state the languages such as "Language:E" for English). If there is data in one language but not another, the field in the language with no data would be erased.</p>
<p>Note that that data for checkbox-type fields will appear as either a <strong>0</strong> for <strong>unchecked</strong>, or <strong>1</strong> for <strong>checked</strong>. If the checkbox field also allows nulls, an <strong>empty</strong> value would indicate <strong>unknown</strong>.</p>
<p>Dates and times are formatted in the <em>ISO Date Format</em> rather than the format usually displayed by CIOC. Once the data is imported, it will display in the usual CIOC format.</p>
