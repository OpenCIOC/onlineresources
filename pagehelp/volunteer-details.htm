<p>The <em>&quot;Record Details&quot;</em> page lists all the details of an organization that are visible from your current View. A Super User can change which fields are available in the View from within the View setup. The field names and order can be changed from within the <em>&quot;Field Display&quot;</em> setup. Note that the fields under <em>&quot;Other Agency Information&quot;</em> are included automatically by the software and cannot be changed.</p>
<p>This help page outlines 6 major sections of Actions available from the Record Details on this page:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="#search">Moving through Search Results</a></li>
	<li><a href="#yes">Yes, I'd Like to Volunteer / Create Referral</a></li>
	<li><a href="#menu">Record Details Menu Items</a></li>
	<li><a href="#agency">Agency Details Menu Items</a></li>
	<li><a href="#other">Other Links on the Details Page</a></li>
	<li><a href="#view">Changing Your View</a></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<a name="search"></a>
<h3>Moving through Search Results</h3>
<p>If this record is one of a number of records returned form your last search, you will see links at the top and bottom of the record:</p>
<img src="../images/first.gif" width="16" height="12"> First <img src="../images/previous.gif" width="14" height="12"> Previous | Next <img src="../images/next.gif" width="14" height="12"> Last <img src="../images/last.gif" width="16" height="12"> (10 of 100 Total)
<p>You can use the <em>First</em>, <em>Previous</em>, <em>Next</em> and <em>Last</em> to move through your search results one at a time, or the <em>Total</em> link to return to your results page and see the full list of search results.</p>
<p><span class="Alert">Note</span>: The search results navigation links may not work properly or may not appear at all if you have executed a new search and then used your back button to go back to records from a previous search. For these links to work reliably, you need to have come to the Record Details pages directly from the <em>&quot;Search Results&quot;</em> page without performing another search in your browser.</p>
<p align="center">[ <a href="#top" style="text-decoration:none">Top</a> ]</p>

<hr>
<a name="yes"></a>
<h3>Yes, I'd Like to Volunteer / Create Referral</h3>
<p>Someone looking to fill a volunteer position can click <em>&quot;Yes, I'd Like to Volunteer!&quot;</em> button to open a request form. When the potential volunteer fills in their contact information and any requests for information, an Email is sent to the Contact in this record as well as the Email for the Agency that owns this record in the database to follow up with the potential volunteer about this position. More information is available from the <em>&quot;Yes, I'd Like to Volunteer&quot;</em> page.</p>
<p>If you have permissions to create a Referral for this record, you will instead see a link to <em>&quot;Create Referral&quot;</em>, which includes everything from the <em>&quot;Yes, I'd Like to Volunteer&quot;</em> form as well as additional fields for data management and tracking your contacts for this Referral. Even if you have permission to create referrals, you will only be able to use the <em>&quot;Create Referral&quot;</em> option for records owned by your own Agency unless you are a Super User.</p>
<p align="center">[ <a href="#top" style="text-decoration:none">Top</a> ]</p>

<a name="menu"></a>
<h3>Record Details Menu Items</h3>
<p>Below the Organization Name at the top of the record will be a menu of links and/or a drop-down menu. These will differ depending upon your login security level and which features are activated in your database.</p>

<a name="copy"></a>
<h4>Copy Record</h4>
<p>If you have permissions to create new records, you will have access to the <em>Copy</em> record feature.

Delete and Restore functions are available only to those with record deletion privileges.</p>

<h4><img src="../images/printer.gif" width="13" height="14"> Print Version</h4>

<h3>Agency Details Menu</h3>
<h4>More Agency Info</h4>
<p>This link is part of the <em>&quot;Agency Details&quot;</em> menu. Clicking this link will take you to the Community Information <em>&quot;Record Details&quot;</em> page for this organization.</p>

<h4>Other Opportunities</h4>
<p>This link is part of the <em>&quot;Agency Details&quot;</em> menu. Clicking this link creates a new search showing all the current Volunteer Opportunities for this organization.</p>

<h4>Create / Suggest New Opportunity</h4>
<p>This link is part of the <em>&quot;Agency Details&quot;</em> menu. Depending on your permissions in the Volunteer module of the database, you will see a link either to <em>Create</em> or <em>Suggest</em> a new Volunteer Opportunity for this organization (See <em>&quot;Suggest an Update&quot;</em> vs. <em>&quot;Update Record&quot;</em> above to note the distinction).</p>
<p align="center">[ <a href="#top" style="text-decoration:none">Top</a> ]</p>

<hr>

<a name="other"></a>
<h3>Other Links on the Details Page...</h3>
<p>Within the record itself, there may be other links to new searches or external websites. Many CIOC fields allow you to enter HTML, giving you the ability to create your own links in the record. Some of the links created by the software include:</p>

<h4>Website and Email Links</h4>
<p>The various website email fields in the software will be linked automatically by the software unless you are viewing the print version of the record. Wherever more than one email address is listed in a single email field, clicking the link will open your email software to compose a message to <strong>all</strong> the addresses listed.</p>
<h4>Social Media Links</h4>
<p>Note that there may be two types of Social Media links available on the page:</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Social Media links <em>about the Organization/Program</em> itself</strong>; this could include links to the organizations Facebook page, Twitter feed, etc.</li>
	<li><strong>Social Media <em>sharing</em> links</strong>; these appear at the upper right of the record (if enabled in the View) and allow the user to share a link to the current record on their own Facebook page, Twitter feed, etc. This feature uses the <a href="http://www.addthis.com/" target="_blank">Add This</a> service, which works hundreds of different social media sites.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Mapping Link</h4>
<p>This link will appear in the &quot;Address&quot; field for an organization <em>only if</em> there is sufficient information in the record to allow for correct mapping. Clicking on this link will open up a map of the organization's location. The MapQuest map will open up in the <em>same window</em> as the database; you will need to use your browser's back button to return to the database after viewing the map. Note that the mailing address field is never mapped.</p>
<p>Which Mapping System is used will depend on the setting in the <em>Map Record</em> field; the choices available are configured in the <em>Mapping Systems</em> setup area.</p>

<h4>Volunteer Areas of Interest and Skills/Experience</h4>
<p>Each <em>Specific Area of Interest</em> or <em>Skills/Experience</em> type associated with the record will be linked. Clicking these links will perform a search for records containing the chosen Areas of Interest.</p>
<p align="center">[ <a href="#top" style="text-decoration:none">Top</a> ]</p>

<hr>

<a name="view"></a>
<h3>Changing Your View</h3>
<p>If your security level permits it, you will also see a drop down menu at the top of the page where you can change your View of the database; this may change the look of the record display page, or change which fields are available. Unlike changing your View from the Main Menu, this change is temporary and will last only while you look at this record. <span class="Alert">Important Note</span>: you can only update records in your own View; if you switch to another View other than your default, you will no longer have access to the <em>Update Record</em> link.</p>
