<p class="Alert">Note: the contents of this page vary depending on whether you are working in a database with other CIOC Members (a <em>&quot;Multi-Member&quot;</em> database).</p>
<p>The <em><strong>Manage Agencies</strong></em> page allows you to add a new Agency (AKA <em>Record Owner</em>) to the database or edit an existing Agency. <span class="Alert">It is very important to have an entry for <strong>every record owner code</strong> used for records in your database, including an email address and associated organization (Community Information) record so that feedback emails can be processed correctly.</span></p>
<h3>Add a New Agency</h3>
<p>Click the <em>&quot;Add New Agency&quot;</em> link to be taken to a form for entering information for a new Agency. Global Super Users (Super Users that control values shared by all Members in this database) have the ability to create an Agency for any Member in the database.</p>
<h3>Edit an Existing Agency</h3>
<p>Under the <em>&quot;Add New Agency&quot;</em> link, there is a table listing all the Agency Codes associated with your CIOC Membership. This table includes a count of all users, Community Information records, and Volunteer records that are owned by each Agency. Click the &quot;Update&quot; link next to the Agency / Record Owner you wish to edit.</p>
<h3>Agencies for Other Members</h3>
<p>If you are working in a Multi-Member database, you will see a listing of Agency Codes belonging to other CIOC Members in your database. You will have the option to select one or more of these codes for display on your own update and search forms. Global Super Users (Super Users that control values shared by all Members in this database) will have the ability to manage these Agencies belonging to other Members.</p>
