<p>The <em>&quot;Mark Record(s) Deleted&quot;</em> page allows you to set the date on which a record should be deleted. In some cases, you may land on this page while restoring a record that was previously marked for deletion.</p>

<h3>Marking a Record Deleted</h3>
<p>If the date you enter on this page is in the past, the record will immediately become unavailable in regular searches (it may still be available in <em>Advanced Search</em> if deleted records are visible in the current View). If you set a date in the future, the record will be <em>&quot;pending deletion&quot;</em> and will be removed from searches at 12:00:00 AM EST on the date specified.</p>
<p>You may optionally set the record to <em>non-public</em> status at the same time; this is useful for instance if you want it to disappear from staff searches in 6 months, but want it removed from public view immediately. Note that this feature only works in one direction - it can only set records to <em>non-public</em>. Unchecking the box will not make records <em>public</em> if they are currently <em>non-public</em>.</p>
<p>Note that you cannot restore the record by leaving the date blank after following a delete record link; attempts to leave the date blank will insert today's date. If you wish to restore the record, you can do so by clicking the &quot;Restore&quot; link from within the <em>&quot;Record Details&quot;</em> page, or the <em>&quot;Manage Deleted Records&quot;</em> page.</p>

<h3>Restoring a Record</h3>
<p>After clicking the &quot;Restore&quot; link for a record, the record is automatically restored; no further action is required on this page. You may return to the Record Details or Deleted Records pages by clicking the appropriate links.</p>
