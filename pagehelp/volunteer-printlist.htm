<h2>Printing a List of Records</h2>
<p>Print Profiles are associated with particular Views; a Super User can create or edit Print Profiles and assign them to Views by going to <em>Setup &gt; Print Profiles</em>. If you do not have any Print Profiles available in your View, you will not be able to use this function.</p>
<h4>Step 1: Selecting your Records and Profile</h4>
<p>The Print Tools in the Volunteer module of the software are currently only available through the <em>&quot;Select Checkbox&quot;</em> action on a group of records from search results. After selecting the records, the first step will have been to select the name of the Print Profile you wish to use, and choosing a sort order for the final report.</p>
<h4>Step 2: Customizing your Message</h4>
<p>After selecting the records you want to print and a Print Profile, you will have the opportunity to edit, add to or remove the default report message for the selected Print Profile. Depending on the Profile settings, this message might appear once at the top of the report, or before each record in the report.</p>
<h4>Step 3: Viewing your Report</h4>
<p>After you have customized your message, clicking <em>&quot;Next&quot;</em> will open your report in a new window. After printing or saving your report, you can close the window with the report and return to your previous window to continue working in the database.</p>
