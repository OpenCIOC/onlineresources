<p>The <em>&quot;Record Details&quot;</em> page lists all the details of the record that are visible from your current View. A Super User can change which fields are available in the View, and what headings group the fields together, from within the View setup. The field names and order can be changed from within the <em>&quot;Field Display&quot;</em> setup.</p>
<p>This help page outlines 5 major sections of Actions available from the Record Details on this page:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="#search">Moving through Search Results</a></li>
	<li><a href="#name">Organization Name Links</a></li>
	<li><a href="#menu">Record Details Menu Items</a></li>
	<li><a href="#other">Other Links on the Details Page</a></li>
	<li><a href="#view">Changing Your View</a></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<a name="search"></a>
<h3>Moving through Search Results</h3>
<p>If this record is one of a number of records returned form your last search, you will see links at the top and bottom of the record:</p>
<img src="../images/first.gif" width="16" height="12"> First <img src="../images/previous.gif" width="14" height="12"> Previous | Next <img src="../images/next.gif" width="14" height="12"> Last <img src="../images/last.gif" width="16" height="12"> (10 of 100 Total)
<p>You can use the <em>First</em>, <em>Previous</em>, <em>Next</em> and <em>Last</em> to move through your search results one at a time, or the <em>Total</em> link to return to your results page and see the full list of search results.</p>
<p><span class="Alert">Note</span>: The search results navigation links may not work properly or may not appear at all if you have executed a new search and then used your back button to go back to records from a previous search. For these links to work reliably, you need to have come to the Record Details pages directly from the <em>&quot;Search Results&quot;</em> or <em>&quot;Browse By Organization&quot;</em> page without performing another search in your browser.</p>
<p align="center">[ <a href="#top" style="text-decoration:none">Top</a> ]</p>

<hr>

<a name="name"></a>
<h3>Organization Name Links</h3>
<p>CIOC uses a 5-level naming structure, using the fields named ORG_LEVEL_1 through ORG_LEVEL_5 (display names for these fields may vary based on your setup). ORG_LEVEL_1 represents the top-most parent organization, with lower levels representing various branches, programs or locations. If you use this structure properly and consistently, you will be able to use the name-linking feature to search for records belonging to the same parent organization structure at any level from 1 through 4 where at least one matching record is found. This feature is only available if it has been turned on in this View.</p>
<p align="center">[ <a href="#top" style="text-decoration:none">Top</a> ]</p>

<hr>

<a name="menu"></a>
<h3>Record Details Menu Items</h3>
<p>Below the Organization Name at the top of the record will be a menu of links and/or a drop-down menu. These will differ depending upon your login security level and which features are activated in your database.</p>

<p class="Alert SmallNote">* Interface translations currently available only in English and French. To work with any additional languages listed above, you may need to work with CIOC to provide translation services for that language.</p>

<p align="center">[ <a href="#top" style="text-decoration:none">Top</a> ]</p>

<a name="copy"></a>
<h4>Copy Record</h4>
<p>If you have permissions to create new records, you will have access to the <em>Copy</em> record feature. You will have an opportunity to select specific fields from this record to copy from those you have permission to update. To copy a record, you must have update permissions on the current record <strong>and</strong> permissions to add new records.</p>
<p align="center">[ <a href="#top" style="text-decoration:none">Top</a> ]</p>

<a name="delete"></a>
<h4>Delete / Restore</h4>
<p><em>Delete</em> will allow you to set a deletion date for the record; records with a past deletion date are no longer available in regular searches, while records with a deletion date in the future will remain active until the date has passed. Deleted records will show a <em>Restore</em> link instead; restoring the record will remove its deletion date. Delete and Restore functions are available only to those with record deletion privileges.</p>
<p align="center">[ <a href="#top" style="text-decoration:none">Top</a> ]</p>

<a name="servcats"></a>
<h4>Update Service Categories</h4>
<p>This drop-down menu option allows you to update the Service Category (Human Services Taxonomy) indexing of the record. This option is available only to users with permissions to index with the Taxonomy, and is independent of the ability to update the rest of the record.</p>
<p align="center">[ <a href="#top" style="text-decoration:none">Top</a> ]</p>

<a name="pubs"></a>
<h4>Update Publications</h4>
<p>Link to update the list of Publication codes attached to this record, as well as any related Publication information such as Publication-specific descriptions and General Headings. This link is visible if you have permissions to update publications, and you are not currently in a <em>Limited Publication View</em>. If you are working in such a <em>&quot;Limited&quot;</em> View, you will see an <em>&quot;Update Description/Headings&quot;</em> link instead.</p>
<p align="center">[ <a href="#top" style="text-decoration:none">Top</a> ]</p>

<a name="headings"></a>
<h4>Update Description/Headings</h4>
<p>Link to update the Publication-specific description and General Headings for the Publication on which your current View is based. This link is visible only when working in a <em>Limited Publication View</em>, if you have permissions to edit Publication information.</p>
<p align="center">[ <a href="#top" style="text-decoration:none">Top</a> ]</p>

<a name="email"></a>
<h4>Email Update Request</h4>
<p>This link will take you to a page where you can compose/customize an email to the organization to request an update to their information. This link is available if you have permissions to send update requests, the organization has an email address available for updates contained in the record, and the <em>&quot;Block Update Email&quot;</em> field has not been set in this record.</p>
<p align="center">[ <a href="#top" style="text-decoration:none">Top</a> ]</p>

<a name="mail"></a>
<h4>Mail Form</h4>
<p>The Mail Form option from the drop-down menu is intended to be used when an you are not able to use the Email Update Request functionality to request an update to this record. If you have defined a Print Template for this View, the Mail/Fax form will use this template. As with the Feedback page, the Mail/Fax form gathers contact information based on what is specified for the owner Agency in the Agency setup.</p>
<p>You may want to go into your browser's &quot;Page Setup&quot; (found under the &quot;File&quot; menu) and expand your margins and/or remove header and footer information prior to printing. Removing header and footer information from the page setup will prevent your browser from automatically printing out page numbers, the url for the page, date and time information, etc. Increasing your page margins may also reduce the number of pages necessary to print out the update form.</p>
<p>The Mail Form opens in a new window or browser tab. When you are finished, close the window or tab to be returned to the previous page you were using in the database.</p>
<p align="center">[ <a href="#top" style="text-decoration:none">Top</a> ]</p>

<a name="volopps"></a>
<h4><img src="../images/handshake.gif" width="22" height="14"> Volunteer Opportunities</h4>
<p>Available only the if Volunteer module is being used. If there are current Volunteer Opportunities associated with this record available in your current View of the Volunteer database, a link will be provided to bring up a list of those Volunteer Opportunity records.</p>
<p align="center">[ <a href="#top" style="text-decoration:none">Top</a> ]</p>

<a name="createvol"></a>
<h4>Create / <img src="../images/new.gif" width="13" height="14"> Suggest a Volunteer Opportunity</h4>
<p>Available only the if Volunteer module is being used. Depending on your permissions in the Volunteer module of the database, you will see a link either to <em>Create</em> or <em>Suggest</em> a new Volunteer Opportunity (See <em>&quot;Suggest an Update&quot;</em> vs. <em>&quot;Update Record&quot;</em> above to note the distinction). The Create option will be found in the drop-down menu, while the Suggest option is available as a link with an icon, as in the above title. Note that the <em>Suggest</em> link may be blocked from display, depending on the setup of the current Volunteer View.</p>
<p align="center">[ <a href="#top" style="text-decoration:none">Top</a> ]</p>

<a name="print"></a>
<h4>Print Version</h4>
<p>If a <em>Print Template</em> has been specified for the current View, you will have access to a link that will open the record in a new window. Print versions are formatted for printing using the template provided, and all system-generated links and menu items will be hidden.</p>
<p align="center">[ <a href="#top" style="text-decoration:none">Top</a> ]</p>

<a name="reminders"></a>
<h4>Reminders</h4>
<p>The <em>Reminders</em> link allows you to view, edit, or add to the reminders tied to this record. If the record has a currently active reminder, an icon will appear next to the reminder link. An alarm icon <img src="../images/remind.gif" width="17" height="17"> signifies active reminders, while an alert icon <img src="../images/reminder_alert.gif" width="15" height="14"> signifies that at least one reminder is past due.

<h3>Other Links on the Details Page...</h3>
<p>Within the record itself, there may be other links to new searches or external websites. Many CIOC fields allow you to enter HTML, giving you the ability to create your own links in the record. Some of the links created by the software include:</p>

<h4>Website and Email Links</h4>
<p>The various website email fields in the software will be linked automatically by the software unless you are viewing the print version of the record. Wherever more than one email address is listed in a single email field, clicking the link will open your email software to compose a message to <strong>all</strong> the addresses listed.</p>
<h4>Social Media Links</h4>
<p>Note that there may be two types of Social Media links available on the page:</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Social Media links <em>about the Organization/Program</em> itself</strong>; this could include links to the organizations Facebook page, X (Twitter) feed, etc.</li>
	<li><strong>Social Media <em>sharing</em> links</strong>; these appear at the upper right of the record (if enabled in the View) and allow the user to share a link to the current record on their own Facebook page, X (Twitter) feed, etc. This feature uses the <a href="http://www.addthis.com/" target="_blank">Add This</a> service, which works hundreds of different social media sites.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Mapping Link</h4>
<p>This link will appear in the &quot;Address&quot; field for an organization <em>only if</em> there is sufficient information in the record to allow for correct mapping. Clicking on this link will open up a map of the organization's location. The MapQuest map will open up in the <em>same window</em> as the database; you will need to use your browser's back button to return to the database after viewing the map. Note that the mailing address field is never mapped.</p>
<p>Which Mapping System is used will depend on the setting in the <em>Map Record</em> field; the choices available are configured in the <em>Mapping Systems</em> setup area.</p>

<h4>Classification System Links (Subject, Taxonomy, Publication, Distribution, NAICS etc)</h4>
<p>Depending on your view of the database, you will see various subject/term, publication/heading, distribution, NAICS, broader and related term links within the record fields. Clicking these links will perform a search for records containing the chosen term or code.</p>
<h4>Other Search Links</h4>
<p>A number of other fields also include links to new searches, including:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Accreditation</li>
	<li>Bus Routes</li>
	<li>Certification</li>
	<li>&quot;Extra&quot; Checklist fields (names will vary)</li>
	<li>&quot;Extra&quot; Drop-down fields (names will vary)</li>
	<li>Membership</li>
	<li>Schools in Area / School Escort (Child Care)</li>
	<li>Type of Program (Child Care)</li>
	<li>Type of Care (Child Care)</li>
</ul>

<a name="view"></a>
<h3>Changing Your View</h3>
<p>If your security level permits it, you will also see a drop down menu at the top of the page where you can change your View of the database; this may change the look of the record display page, or change which fields are available. Unlike changing your View from the Main Menu, this change is temporary and will last only while you look at this record. <span class="Alert">Important Note</span>: you can only update records in your own View; if you switch to another View other than your default, you will no longer have access to the <em>Update Record</em> link.</p>
