<p>You can also use the <em>Preferred Term Compliance Report</em> tool to help you to update your activations to better match the list of Preferred Terms. Preferred Terms do not change activations in any way, but are intended as a guide for Taxonomy managers wishing to standardize on common sets of Terms. Preferred Terms will be taken into account when using activation suggestion tools, and will be highlighted when using the Drill-Down activation tool. To modify the list of Preferred Terms, use the <em>Manage Preferred Taxonomy Term List</em> tool.</p>

<p>Instructions for basic use of the tool and the meaning of the various icons and action types are explained inline on the report page. Options that are selected by default are relatively safe changes, including deactivation of completely unused Terms and roll-up to higher-level preferred Terms. Submitting the report with the pre-selected actions is a good way to reduce the size of the compliance report and actions to be considered. Changes such as activation of new Terms and deactivation of Terms for which no preferred Term is available are not selected by default, and should be at reviewed in a least a basic way before any action is taken. You can use the "Check All" button to select all non-default actions at once.</p>

<p>Terms marked <em>Evaluation Required</em> cannot be made compliant automatically. Usually this requires activation of lower-level Preferred Terms, and then manual re-indexing to the lower-level Terms. Click the usage count link to bring up a list of records in the current View using the non-compliant Term.</p>

<p><span class="Alert">The Compliance Report is branch-specific</span>. Terms are only considered for compliance if there is at least one Preferred Term specified on the same branch (including sibling Terms). This means it is possible to specify a preferred Term list for the Terms in the B branch, but not any other branch, for example: in that case the other (non-B) branches would not be considered for this report.</p>
