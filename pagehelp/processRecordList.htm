<h4>New Reminder</h4>
<p>The Reminders system is intended to assist users in creating task lists for themselves and other users, as well as provide a means of communicating information to other CIOC users. Reminders can be for general tasks or communications, or they may be tied to one or more records. You can work with reminders by clicking the Reminders link in your site bar, or (in the case of Reminders tied to specific records), through the Record Details page. You can also create a reminder for a group of records through your search results. Click the &quot;Next&quot; button to begin creating a new reminder for the selected records.</p>

<h4>Print Map</h4>
<p>If you have geo-coded (mapped) the records in your database, you can generate a numbered map for printing out a map and list of records. You may map a maximum of 99 records at a time (fewer records produce a more readable and useful result).</p>
<p align="center">[ <a href="#top" style="text-decoration:none">Top</a> ]</p>

<a name="stats"></a>

<p>The form for generating statistics reports on selected records is nearly identical to what is available from the regular <em>Statistics Search</em> screen. Refer to the help files available on the regular statistics pages for more information.</p>

<h4>Add/Remove Heading</h4>

<p>In addition to the general tool to add and remove headings, you may also synchronize your indexing for the current publication to the indexing that was done on another publication. This will only apply to cases where the same headings exist in both publications. <span class="Alert">It is important to choose one Publication as the "master"</span>, in which you will maintain the indexing for the record, and then copy it to other publications. You will select the <em>master</em> publication from the &quot;Synchronize Headings to the classifications found in&quot; drop down.</p>

If you choose the <em>&quot;Delete All&quot;</em> option, you will be asked to check a box to confirm that you wish to remove every NAICS code from the selected records.</p>
<p align="center">[ <a href="#top" style="text-decoration:none">Top</a> ]</p>

<a name="pub"></a>
<h4>Add/Remove Publication Code</h4>
<p>This allows you to either add or remove a <em>Publication Code</em> from the selected set of records. You must select either <em>&quot;Add&quot;</em> or <em>&quot;Delete&quot;</em> from the first drop-down menu and then select from the available Publication codes in the second drop-down menu. <em>Note the alert text on the page</em> as deleting a Publication code from records has other potential implications beyond simply removing the code from the record(s). A user with Publication management privileges can add new codes to the list by going to <em>Publication</em> from the Main Menu. If you choose the <em>&quot;Delete All&quot;</em> option, you will be asked to check a box to confirm that you wish to remove every Publication code from the selected records.</p>

If you do not know the Code of the Term you want to Add/Remove, use the link to the <em>Service Category Finder</em> tool provided.</p>
<p>If you are <em>Removing</em> an existing Term from the records, some additional options apply. Because some Taxonomy Terms may occur within a list of linked Terms, you must choose what to do when the Term is found within a set of linked Terms. By default, the Term will only be removed if it is not linked together with any other Terms.</p>
<p>If you choose the <em>&quot;Delete All&quot;</em> option, you will be asked to check a box to confirm that you wish to remove all Taxonomy indexing from the selected records.</p>

<p>This function allows you to update the map location of a list of records. By default, this tool will use the existing mapping setting and confirm that the map location is correct according to current address or intersection information (as applicable). You may optionally change or set the mapping type (to site location, intersection, or do not map) and/or set the mapping category of records that are updated. To see the category name (if available), hold your mouse over the map pin (hold mouse over the pin to display &quot;Mapping Category&quot; <img src="../images/mapping/mm_0_white_20.png" width="12" height="20" title="Mapping Category">).</p>
