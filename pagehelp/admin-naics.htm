<p><span class="Alert">Important Note</span>: The <em>North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)</em> is a standardized classification system managed through Statistics Canada; it is generally not recommended to add to or edit the values in the system. The version currently supplied by CIOC is NAICS 2002.</p>
<p>The <em><strong>Manage NAICS Codes</strong></em> page allows you to enter a NAICS code to view / edit. To add a code to the system, leave the code area blank and click <em>"View/Edit Code"</em>. To edit an existing code, you must know the 2-6 digit numeric code that you want to edit; if you do not know the code number, click the <em>&quot;NAICS Code Finder&quot;</em> link to open a pop-up window allowing you to search or browse through the NAICS system.</p>
