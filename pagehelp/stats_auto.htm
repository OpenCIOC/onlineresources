<p>&quot;Quick Reports&quot; are automatically generated reports with pre-determined criteria. Reports show record views or changes over the most recent 3 month period: they will include whatever stats are available for the current month, as well as the stats for each of the previous two months.</p>
<p class="Alert">All auto-reports for record views include all values, including those generated by bots or crawlers.</p>

<h3>Data Management Report</h3>
<p>This report lists how many records have a change date of some kind that falls within the current month or the two previous months. <strong>This report is not based on the full change history system</strong>, just the current value for each of the given date fields, so its accuracy diminishes over time - particularly the "last modified" information.</p>
<p>In a multi-member database, the report further breaks records down statistics between records owned by your membership (local) vs. those shared with you by other members.</p>

<h3>Record Views by Record Owner</h3>
<p>This report breaks down record view by month, record owner agency, and public vs. logged in users.</p>

<a name="viewsbyview"></a>
<h3>Record Views by View</h3>
<p>This report breaks down record view by month, the View being accessed, and public vs. logged in users.</p>

<a name="ipsbyowner"></a>
<h3>Number of Unique IPs by Record Owner</h3>
<p>This report breaks down record view by month, record owner agency, and unique IP Address.</p>

<a name="ipsbyview"></a>
<h3>Number of Unique IPs by View</h3>
<p>This report breaks down record view by month, the View being accessed, and unique IP Address.</p>

<a name="uniqueips"></a>
<h3>Total Number of Unique IPs</h3>
<p>This report indicates the total number of unique IPs in a given month, without further grouping the information with other criteria such as View or Record Owner. This is the report to use to get an overall sense of the number of individual users over the given time periods.</p>

<h3>About Unique IP Stats</h3>
<p>When reviewing stats concerning "unique" IPs, please consider that accesses by the same IP Address may sometimes represent multiple users (if an organization's traffic all appears to come from the same IP Address), and some users may access the database from multiple IP Addresses (due to different locations, computers, or dynamic IP Address allocation). However, this is still generally a reasonable indication of the number of individual users.</p>
