<p>The <em>Manage Preferred Taxonomy Term List</em> tool allows you to input a list of Terms that are preferred for activation. Preferred Terms do not change activations in any way, but are intended as a guide for Taxonomy managers wishing to standardize on common sets of Terms. Preferred Terms will be taken into account when using activation suggestion tools, and will be highlighted when using the Drill-Down activation tool. You can also use the Preferred Term Compliance Report tool to help you to update your activations to better match the list of Preferred Terms.</p>
<p>When updating your list of Preferred Terms, you can either add to your existing list, or reset the entire list. By default, the Terms you enter will be added to your existing list. If you choose to reset the entire list, any Terms not in the list you provided will be removed from the existing Preferred Term list. The list of Terms must consist of valid Level 2 or higher Taxonomy Terms that are separated by any combination of new line, space, tab, comma, or semi-colon (Level 1 Terms are ignored). The flexibility of the format should allow you to easily copy and paste a list of Terms from tables or spreadsheets.</p>

<p>Remember, changing the list of Preferred Terms does not change your data in any way. You may update your list of preferred Terms - or stop using Preferred Terms completely - at any time. Although the list does not change data, do take some care when adding new Terms - currently the only way to remove a Term from the Preferred List is to reset your entire list. <span class="Alert">It is strongly recommended that you save a text file or spreadsheet of your Preferred Term list so that you can easily reset it if needed.</span> You can also generate the list out of your Microsoft Access download using a query of the TAX_Term table.</p>
