<p>The <em>Import Record Report</em> page displays a list of records that have been successfully added or updated from the given export file.</p>
<p>The <em>Record Owner</em> field in this report represents the owner as designated in the export file, not the current owner of the record in the database.</p>
<p>If there were any issues encountered while importing the record, it will be reported in the <em>Import Report</em> field. Types of issues encountered may include checklists or classification items that were used in the source database that do not appear in this database; if an action was taken to resolve the discrepancy (such as moving a checklist item into the general notes field), or if data was not able to be imported, this will be noted in the report.</p>
