<p>The <strong><em>North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)</em></strong> is used to classify businesses based on the type of products and/or services they provide. The Canadian version of this system is used in the software by permission from Statistics Canada. The classification structure is a hierarchy, starting with a set of two-digit codes representing major industry <em>Sectors</em>. The system then further divides each Sector into finer sub-categories (Subsector, Industry Group, Industry, and National Industry) with codes ranging from 3-6 digits.</p>
<p>Clicking the <em>Search</em> link as you browse through the classifications will return a list of records classified under the selected classification category or any of its Sub-Categories. By clicking on the <em>Sub-Categories</em> link next to any of the higher-level classifications, you can narrow your search to a more specific type of industry before returning a list of records. You can reverse your path through the hierarchy by going <em>Up 1 Level</em>, or <em>Return to Top Level</em> to return to the full list of Sectors.</p>
<p>At any time you can use the <em>NAICS Code Finder</em> to open a pop-up window which will allow you to browse or search through the entire NAICS system. If you are not sure which sector is appropriate for the industry you are seeking, a keyword search using the <em>Code Finder</em> may help you to locate the appropriate branch of the system to browse.</p>
