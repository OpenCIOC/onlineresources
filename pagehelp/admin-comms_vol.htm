<p>Volunteer Community information is organized into several layers:</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong><em>Communities</em></strong>: where Opportunities are offered. Drawn 
		from the master list of Communities that is shared with the Community Information module of the database.
		<br>
	</li>
	<li><strong><em>Community Sets</em></strong>: a <em>Community Set</em> allows you to take a selection of <em>Communities</em> and <em>Volunteer Opportunities</em> and make them available in a particular View.
		<br>
	</li>
	<li><strong><em>Community Groups</em></strong>: each <em>Community Set</em> has its own set of <em>Community Groups</em> which cluster one or more <em>Communities</em> together under the title of your choice.
		<br>
	</li>
	<li><strong><em>Community Group Members</em></strong>: each <em>Community Group</em> contains one or more values from the list of
		<em>Communities</em>, for use as defaults in search and data entry forms.</li>
</ol>
<p>The <strong><em>Volunteer Opportunity Community Management</em></strong> tool allows you to review the assignment of <em>Volunteer Opportunities</em> to specific <em>Community Sets</em> and add or remove a number of Opportunities from a Set at once.</p>
