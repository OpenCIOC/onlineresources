<h2>Quick Add Taxonomy General Headings</h2>

<p>The Quick Add Taxonomy General Headings tool allows you create a large number of Taxonomy-based Headings at one time. Using a Taxonomy drill-down search, you may select a number of Taxonomy Terms at once and create a new set of General Headings based on the selected Terms. You will not be able to add Terms that already exist in your list of Headings; this includes regular Headings with the same name as the Taxonomy Term. This tool creates one Heading per Term; it does not support linked Terms or creating Headings based on multiple Terms, but you may edit the Terms list later if you require a more complex search.</p>
