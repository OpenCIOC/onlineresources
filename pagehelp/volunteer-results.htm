<p class="Alert">These instructions are shared by several different types of searches, including the Main Page (Basic) Search, Advanced Search, Step-by-Step Search, New Results Set (using checkboxes to create a new list of records), Previous Search Results, and various &quot;Browse&quot; searches. Not all features exist for all searches; see notes in each section if applicable.</p>
<p>The <em>Search Results</em> page displays records that match the criteria you entered from either a Basic or Advanced search. If the message that appears on this page is: <em>&quot;There are no records that match your criteria&quot;</em>, then there are no records in the database that match the criteria you chose. In this case, use your back button or return to the Main Menu / Start Page or Advanced Search page and begin a new search that is less restrictive.</p>
<p>At the top of the page, a legend is printed mapping specific community group names to coloured balls. The coloured balls are printed next to the opportunities, indicating in which general areas the position is offered. The setup for which communities are grouped together, the names of the groupings, and the coloured ball associated with the group can be changed by a Super User from the Volunteer <em>Communities</em> setup.</p>
<p>Each record in your search results will have a link to view the full <strong>Record Details</strong>. The link will be found on either the <em>Position Title</em> or <em>Opportunity ID</em>. Whether the name or ID is linked is determined by your <em>Display Options</em>, discussed below.</p>

<h3>About Your Search</h3>
<p>Most searches include a description of your search at the top of the page. From <em>Advanced Search</em>, the default is that the details of your search are <em>not</em> included, but you can check a box at the bottom of the search form to have the details of your search printed on the results page. When the details of your search are available, the information can be used to describe your search when you <em>Refine Your Search</em>, when you view your list of <em>Recent Searches</em>, and when you <em>Save Your Search</em>.</p>

<a name="refine"></a>
<h3>Refine Your Search</h3>
<p>Clicking the <img border="0" src="../images/zoom.gif" width="17" height="14">&nbsp;<em>Refine Search</em> link at the top of your search results will send the current search criteria to the <em>Advanced Search</em> form so that you can add additional criteria to search within the current results.</p>

<a name="display"></a>
<h3>Record List Display Options</h3>
<p>All users with a login into the database have the option of changing the way their search results are displayed. The exact options you have available to you for your display will be determined by your permissions in the database. You can change your display options temporarily for your session, or save your changes as your default to use every time you log into the database. To change your settings, click the <em>Change Display Options</em> link; a pop-up window will appear that allows you to modify your current settings. Note that your changes will not be reflected until you perform a new search, or refresh your current search results page.</p>
<p><span class="Alert">Very Important Note</span>: the <em>Use Table Format</em> option (discussed in the <a href="#options">Show Options</a> section below) is required for many of the options to be available. The regular view (with <em>Table Format</em> turned off) is only intended for basic searching needs.</p>

<a name="fields"></a>
<h4>Show Fields</h4>
<p><em>Show Fields</em> allows you to decide what information from your records will be shown in your results. You may select from a set of predefined fields, as well as choose an unlimited number of &quot;Custom&quot; fields. The list of Custom fields available to you is determined by what information you are allowed to see from the <em>Record Details</em> page.</p>
<p>The <em>Alert Column</em> is a special box that appears on the far left of your search results. Your permissions dictate whether you will be able to see the Alert Column, and which alerts you are allowed to see. If you are not using the <em>Table Format</em> for your display, the Alert Column is not available, and some of these alerts will instead be printed beside the link to the Opportunity Details. The following are a list of the available alerts:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong><span class="Alert">Alert Coloured</span> Box / N</strong> - When the alert column is coloured, the record is <strong>N</strong>on-public (the letter N is used if there is no alert column)</li>
	<li><strong>C</strong> - Record has <strong>C</strong>omments or an Internal Memo</li>
	<li><strong>E</strong> - Record is <strong>E</strong>pired (Display Until Date has passed)</li>
	<li><strong>F</strong> - Record has <strong>F</strong>eedback</li>
	<li><strong>P</strong> - Record is <strong>P</strong>ending deletion (a deletion date set in the future)</li>
	<li><strong>S</strong> - Record has been <strong>S</strong>hared with you by another CIOC Member in your database</li>
	<li><strong>X</strong> - Record has been deleted</li>
</ul>

<a name="options"></a>
<h4>Show Options</h4>
<p><em>Show Options</em> will provide you direct links to perform various types of operations on your list of records. The exact options available to you will depend on your permissions.</p>
<p>The default display (<strong>not</strong> <em>Table Format</em>) prints the Position Title, coloured balls indicating the communities where the positions are available, the <em>Duties</em> field, and the name of the Organization offering the position. The <em>Use Table Format</em> option allows the user to change the display into a table with column headings, with each record printed as one row of the table. This is similar to the results display for the Community Information module of the software, and <strong>makes many of the other display options possible</strong>, including the <em>Show Fields</em> options described in the next section.</p>
<p>The <em>Select Checkbox</em> option is used to perform operations on many records at once. A checkbox will appear beside each record in your results, allowing you to select the records you want and perform operations on them. Some options (depending on your permissions) include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Create a new results set from selected records</li>
	<li>Create a new reminder for the selected records</li>
	<li>Print a list of records</li>
	<li>Create usage statistics reports</li>
	<li>Bulk Email Update Request</li>
	<li>Add or remove &quot;Areas of Interest&quot;</li>
	<li>Set the Public status for the selected records</li>
	<li>Delete / Restore Records</li>
	<li>Change the owner of the selected records</li>
	<li>Add the selected records to a Sharing Profile to make it available to another CIOC Member in your database</li>
</ul>

<a name="sort"></a>
<h4>Sort by</h4>
<p>This section allows you to change the order in which records are listed. You may select from one of the pre-defined sort options, or a custom choice from the drop-down list.</p>

<a name="print"></a>
<h3>Print Version</h3>
<p>If you want to print a report of your search results, clicking the <em>Print Version</em> link (next to <em>Change Display Options</em>) will allow you to see a report of your results formatted for printing, without the menu and extra links. The Super User of the database can customize this print version and optimize it for printing by creating a special <em>Design Template</em> just for printing, and adding it to the current <em>View</em>.</p>

<a name="save"></a>
<h3>Save This Search</h3>
<p>To save your search criteria to your list of saved searches, click the <em>&quot;Save This Search&quot;</em> link. Helpful Hint: If the details of your search are displayed at the top of the page, they will be carried over to the notes field of your search.</p>
<p class="Alert">This feature is not available when performing a &quot;Browse&quot; search, or when working with a &quot;New Results Set&quot; or viewing &quot;Previous Search Results&quot;.</p>
