<p>The <strong><em>Record Inclusion Policy</em></strong> page is where information is entered to display to users who are at the <em>&quot;Suggest a New Record&quot;</em> page of the database (feedback.asp). The text entered here opens in a pop-up window when the <em>&quot;Record Inclusion Policy&quot;</em> link at the top of feedback.asp is clicked. Once you have created <em>Inclusion Policies</em> for your database, you will be able to select a policy for each language for use in a given <em>View</em> from within the View setup page. You may create multiple policies, or have just one policy for all modules (Community Information and Volunteer) and Views. Inclusion Policies are language-specific.</p>
<p>If there is no Inclusion Policy text, no link will be provided on the form. It is <strong>strongly</strong> recommended that you have at least a basic Inclusion Policy available if you intend to provide people with a link to suggest new records.</p>
<p>Clicking the <em>&quot;View the current Inclusion Policy page&quot;</em> link will display the policy currently saved to the database in a pop-up window. Note that your changes will not be reflected until you click the <em>&quot;Submit Updates&quot;</em> button at the bottom of the form to save your changes.</p>
<p>Inclusion Policy text can include HTML formatting and links. For example, you may want to add all of your inclusion information to appear within the pop-up window itself or you may prefer (particularly if you have a lengthy inclusion criteria document) to provide a link to an existing inclusion policy at another location. If you want your inclusion policy page to link to a file on another site, you may want it to open <em>within a new full-size window</em>; if so, use the <strong>target=&quot;_blank&quot;</strong> attribute within the <strong>&lt;a href=&quot;...&quot;&gt;</strong> tag you use to create your link.</p>
