<p>This page is for generating the export file once you have chosen your export format and which records to export. Depending on the number of records and the format for export you have chosen, it may take <strong>considerable</strong> time for the export to complete with no indication of progress appearing.</p>
<p>While the export is still in process, <em>&quot;Starting Export, The export is currently processing. This may take some time...&quot;</em> will appear on the page. Be patient while the export is processed as there may be no indication on the page of the export progress in some cases (Note that the Sharing format does provide a progress bar in <em>most</em> browsers). If you navigate away from this page during processing, the export file will still be created in most cases but will not be accessible because no link will be provided to you. For that reason, please be patient - do not reload the screen, and do not leave the page and return. This will cause many large files to be created on the server unnecessarily.</p>
<p>Once the export has been completed, <em>&quot;Export Complete! Right click the link below and select 'Save File As' to download&quot;</em> will appear on the page. At this time the export is complete. To download the processed export file to your machine, <strong>right</strong> click on the &quot;Export File&quot; link and choose &quot;Save File As..&quot; or &quot;Save Target As...&quot; The actual wording of this choice on your browser menu will depend on the specific browser you are using. In most installations of the software, your file will be zipped (compressed) by default, and you will need to use a zip utility such as <a href="http://www.7-zip.org">7-zip</a> to open it. You should use the compressed version when possible, as it is smaller and faster to download. You may also receive a link to an alternate, uncompressed version of the file. In some databases, these may be reversed (unzipped link first).</p>
<p class="Alert">You may be presented with a link to the <em>Uncompressed</em> (unzipped) version of the file. Please do not use this link unless you have an issue working with zipped files; the uncompressed file will take much longer to download and use more bandwidth.</p>
<p>If you accidentally left click on the file, your browser will attempt to open the file. If you do accidentally open the file, use your browser's back button to return to the &quot;Export File&quot; link and <strong>right</strong> click on the file export link.</p>
<p>It is recommended that you save the file to your local computer. From there you can work with the exported file in whatever way you choose.</p>
