<p>This page allows you to create or update a Volunteer Referral. Unlike the publicly available <em>Yes, I'd like to Volunteer!</em> option, this form allows you to edit additional administrative information about the Referral, and decide whether or not to send out notification Emails to various parties. This page is only available for Super Users and those with the <em>Can Manage Referrals</em> permission set in the User Type. If you are not a Super User, you will only be able to use this page for Opportunities owned by your Agency; for all other Opportunities, you would have to use the <em>Yes, I'd like to Volunteer!</em> option, just like the public.</p>

<hr>

<h3>About the Opportunity</h3>
<p>At the top of the page, there is a table that provides a link to the Opportunity, the Position Title and Organization Name, the Duties of the position, and information about the Contact Person at the Organization for this Opportunity.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Administration Options</h3>
<p>This section contains internal information not available on the <em>Yes, I'd Like to Volunteer!</em> form. This information is not sent when notifications go to the Volunteer or Contact Person for the Opportunity.</p>
<h4>Data Management Fields</h4>
<p>There are fields tracking when this referral was last modified and who modified it; these values are set automatically. The date the Referral request was made is also available, and while it can be modified, this should generally not be necessary. A Referral Date is required for all Referral requests.</p>
<h4>Follow-Up Flag</h4>
<p>The <em>Follow-Up Flag</em> should be set whenever you need to review a request or do further work on the request. All new requests make through <em>Yes, I'd Like to Volunteer!</em> are flagged automatically. Requests that have been flagged are available from the <em>Referrals Requiring Follow-Up</em> report, available through the <em>Referral Main Menu</em>.</p>
<h4>Contact Tracking</h4>
<p>This form allows you to record your last contact with both the potential Volunteer and the Contact Person for the Opportunity. If the system sends out an Email to the Contact Person notifying them about a Referral request, this will be recorded automatically. If an Email is sent to the potential Volunteer is sent summarizing their referral request, this is <em><strong>not</strong></em> considered a contact and is not recorded automatically.</p>
<h4>Successful Placement</h4>
<p>If you wish to track successful placements through the software, you can take note of whether or not a particular Referral resulted in a Successful Placement. By default, this will be set to <em>Unknown</em>.</p>
<h4>Outcome Notes</h4>
<p><em>Outcome Notes</em> can be used to record internal information about the Referral request, including information about the outcome of the request, contacts made with the potential Volunteer or Contact Person for the Opportunity, or details about any Follow-Up required.</p>

<hr>

<h3>About the Potential Volunteer</h3>
<p>The information in this section is identical the the fields available on the <em>Yes, I'd Like to Volunteer!</em> form. If you choose to send out notifications about the request when a new request is created, only the information from this section will be sent out to the recipients.</p>
