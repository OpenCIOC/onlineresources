<h2>Manage Taxonomy</h2>
<a name="create"></a>
<h3>Create New Term</h3>
<p>To create a new TaxonomyTerm, click the <strong>Create New Taxonomy Term</strong> link. You will be taken to a form to enter the term information.</p>

<a name="edit"></a>
<h3>Edit Existing Term</h3>
<p>To edit an existing Subject Term, use one of the Search types in the menu (<em>Keyword</em>, <em>Code</em>, <em>Drill-Down</em>, <em>Related Concept</em>) to locate the Term(s) you want to edit. An edit icon (<img src="../images/edit.gif" width="15" height="14">) will appear next to the name of the Term; clicking on this icon will bring up a form to edit the Term. If you are having trouble locating the Term you want to edit, try changing your settings to include <em>Inactive</em> Terms, and check that you are not limiting your search to only <em>Terms with Records</em>.</p>

<a name="version"></a>
<h3>Update Taxonomy Version</h3>
<p>This tool allows you to update your Taxonomy version to the most recent one posted to a central location on CIOC's servers (to ensure all members can stay in synch to the same version of the Taxonomy).</p>

<a name="source"></a>
<h3>Manage Source Values</h3>
<p>Each Term can be associated with a <em>Source</em> (i.e. &quot;INFO LINE&quot;). To edit the available list of Source values, click the <strong>Manage Taxonomy Source Values</strong> link.</p>

<a name="facet"></a>
<h3>Manage Facet Values</h3>
<p>Each Term can be associated with a <em>Facet</em> (i.e. &quot;Major Programs&quot;). To edit the available list of Facet values, click the <strong>Manage Taxonomy Facet Values</strong> link.</p>

<hr>
<a name="activation"></a>
<h2>Activation Toolkit</h2>
<p>There are six built-in tools to help you manage your Taxonomy Activations according to best practices:</p>

<a name="activationusage"></a>
<h3>Taxonomy Activation and Usage Report</h3>
<p>A simple report of currently active Terms and the number of times each is used in the database (this may include multiple uses by the same record, e.g. within multiple linked Terms).</p>
	
<a name="drilldown"></a><h3>Drill-Down Activation Tool</h3>
<p>This is the main tool for managing Activations. It allows you to use a drill-down type interface to review all your current activations, and change them with one click. Basic rules are enforced, 	such as not being allowed to inactivate a Term in use, and only allowing terms to be rolled-up as Use References if there is a higher-level Active Term.</p>

<a name="preferred"></a>
<h3>Preferred Taxonomy Terms Tools</h3>
<p>The Preferred Taxonomy Terms tools allow you to input a list of Terms that are preferred for activation (using <em>Manage Preferred Taxonomy Term List</em>) and then evaluate your current compliance to that list of Preferred Term activations (using <em>Preferred Term Compliance Report</em>).</p>

<a name="multilevel"></a>
<h3>Multi-Level Activation Report</h3>
<p>Best practice is to activate your Taxonomy at only one level on each branch. This means for each Active Taxonomy Term, there will be no other Active Terms either above or below it in the hierarchy. Use this report to help you identify branches on which you have activated Terms at more than one level.</p>

<a name="recommendation"></a>
<h3>Activation Recommendation Report</h3>
<p>This report uses some general best practices, along with your current usage of the Taxonomy, to make specific recommendations about Terms you should activate or deactivate. You may accept some or all of the recommendations, and the tool can automatically apply your choices.</p>

<hr>
<a name="concept"></a>
<h2>Manage Related Concept Values</h2>
<p>Each Term can be associated with any number of <em>Related Concepts</em> (i.e. &quot;Domestic Violence &quot;). To edit an existing Concept, select it from the drop-down list and click <em>&quot;View / Edit Concept&quot;</em>. To create a new Concept, choose the <em>&quot;&gt;&gt; CREATE NEW &lt;&lt;&quot;</em> option from the drop-down list.</p>
