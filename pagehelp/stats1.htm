<p><span class="Alert">Note:</span> You may find the page help for the <a href="pagehelp?Page=stats.asp&Ln=en-CA">main statistics search form</a> useful for a general overview of the different types of statistics that are kept for your CIOC database and how to use of them appropriately.</p>
<hr>
<p>This page lists records that match the criteria you specified in the main statistics page search form. The list of records returned is sorted in order of usage, and shows three columns: &quot;Record Number&quot;, &quot;Organization Name(s)&quot; and &quot;Usage&quot;.</p>
<p>Unless you specified a user type (i.e. logged in or public) in your search from the main stats page, the &quot;Usage&quot; column reflects <em>total</em> record usage (including both logged in and non logged in use).</p>
<p class="Alert">If you see an entry with no record information at the bottom of this table, this represents statistics that meet your search criteria that were associated with records that have since been permanently deleted from the database.</p>
<p>Note that these values are based on the software's internal Record View Statistics; <span class="Alert">Record View Statistics are not kept when you change to print mode or temporarily change your View</span>, to avoid inflating statistics when a person is looking at multiple versions of the same record for the same purpose.</p>
