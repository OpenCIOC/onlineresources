<p>The <strong><em>Preview Update Email Request</em></strong> page allows you to preview the email message that you are about to send to one or more organizations or contacts.</p>
<p class="Alert">If you are sending an update request to more than one record, your preview will be based on the first record in the queue. If the record being previewed has some special characteristics that are different from other messages being sent out (for example, a bilingual record vs. an English-only record, or a non-public record vs. a public record) then it is possible that the contents of the message will vary slightly for other records in your list.</p>
<p>If you are satisfied with the subject heading and editable body section of the email, click the <em>&quot;Send the Email Message&quot;</em> button at the bottom of the page to send out the email(s).</p>
<p>If you wish to make a change to the email after previewing it, use your browser's back button to return to the previous page where you can edit email details.</p>
