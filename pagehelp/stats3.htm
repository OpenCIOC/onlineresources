<p><span class="Alert">Note:</span> You may find the <a href="pagehelp?Page=stats.asp&Ln=en-CA">page help for the main statistics search form</a> useful for a general overview of the different types of statistics that are kept for your CIOC database and how to use of them appropriately.</p>
<hr>
<p>This page provides a listing of the top 50 records accessed in the database to date, including both public (non-logged in) and total usage (public and logged in). You may have more than 50 records in the results if there is a &quot;tie&quot; in the record count between two or more records at the end of the list; you may also see some ranks repeated or skipped due to ties. If the record is available in your current View, you can view it by clicking on the link on the record number (Note: this link is not available when viewing your report in Print Mode).</p>
<p>Note that these values are based on the software's internal Record View Statistics; <span class="Alert">Record View Statistics are not kept when you change to print mode or temporarily change your View</span>, to avoid inflating statistics when a person is looking at multiple versions of the same record for the same purpose.</p>
<p>At the top of the page are links to several other statistical tools: <em>Main Stats Page</em>, <em>Total Record Use</em>, <em>Use By Agency</em>, <em>Quick Reports</em>, and <em>Delete Old Statistics</em>.</p>
