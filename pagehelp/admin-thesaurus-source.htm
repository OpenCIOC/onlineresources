<p>Each Subject Term can be associated with a <em>Source</em> which is meant to represent where the term originated from (i.e. &quot;InformOntario&quot; or &quot;Local&quot;). This is a general explanation of where the term originated from, unlike the <em>Modified By</em> information that indicates a particular person who last made modifications to the Term. This page allows you to add new source values, as well as edit or delete existing values. Use the <em>&quot;Return to Manage Thesaurus&quot;</em> link at top of page to return to thesaurus management main page.</p>
<h3>Add, Update and Delete</h3>
<p>The entire Source form (all values) are added, updated, or deleted in a single submission. There is one <em>&quot;Update&quot;</em> button that must be used to accept all changes. <span class="Alert">Remember: you must always submit all your changes via the <em>Update</em> button, whether you are adding, updating, or deleting.</span></p>
<p><strong>Add:</strong> To create a new entry, click the <em>&quot;Add New Item&quot;</em> button to insert a row for entering new data. You may enter multiple rows per submission.</p>
<p><strong>Delete:</strong> To delete an existing entry, check the box in the &quot;Delete&quot; column. If a checkbox is unavailable, it is because the item is in use and cannot currently be deleted.</p>
