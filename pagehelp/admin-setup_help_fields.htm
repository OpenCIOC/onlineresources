<p>The <em><strong>Update Field Help</strong></em> selection page is used to choose fields for the purpose of editing <em>Field Help</em>. Field Help links appear next to each field on data entry forms, including adding / updating forms, and feedback forms including <em>&quot;Suggest New Record&quot;</em>. If help is available, a question mark image will appear next the field on the form which will open a pop-up window displaying the help: <img src="../images/help.gif" alt="Help Icon" width="17" height="17" border="0" align="texttop">.</p>
<p>To edit the help text for any field, select it from the list and click the <em>&quot;Edit Field Help&quot;</em> link. If you want to change the friendly name of a field, this is done in a different area (through <em>Setup &gt; Field Display</em>).</p>
<p>Clicking on the <em>&quot;Print Version&quot;</em> links will open a print friendly report of all existing field help in new window (Help can be printed in any language used in the database). Where no field help exists for a given field, the help column in the printout will be blank.</p>
<p><span class="Alert">Important Notes</span>:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Sample</strong> field help may be provided with an installation of the software, but you should review this help to ensure in meets local needs. If you do modify your help, you should keep a backup of your changes and notify the system administrator that you have made changes if an update to the distributed Field Help is announced.</li>
	<li>You can create Field Help for custom fields like <em>Publication</em> Descriptions and Headings. Once you make these fields available on forms through the <em>Publication</em> setup, they will appear in this list for you to add help text.</li>
	<li>There are several fields that are automatically included/excluded at the top of the Update Form, including the Update Date field and Record Number field; the Field Help link for these automatically added fields is always printed, so it is recommended that you make sure there is help information available for all of these fields.</li>
