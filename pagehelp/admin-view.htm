<p><strong><em>Views</em></strong> may be thought of as individual portals into the database. Views control which records are available, which fields can be viewed or edited, which types of searches are available on various search forms, what classification systems to use, the languages the user can work in, custom menu and footer content, <em>Design Templates</em> to use, etc. Views may be configured to be accessible to the public or only to specific logged-in users.</p>
<p>The <em>Manage Views</em> page allows you to create/edit different Views, which can then be made public or assigned to <em>User Types</em>. For example, you may decide to provide a View of the database specifically for a local Community Care Access Centre. Using <em>Views</em> in combination with <em>User Types</em> and <em>Design Templates</em> would allow you to create a very customized view of the database, specifically for use by CCAC staff.</p>
<h3>Edit an Existing View</h3>
<p>To view or edit the settings of an existing View, select the View from the list and click <em>&quot;View / Edit View&quot;</em>. The list of Views is separated by whether the View is available without a login (Public) or only to logged-in users. It is a good idea to periodically review this list to ensure that no Views intended to be private are public.</p>
<p>Views that are exclusively controlled by a particular Agency have that Agency Code at the end of the name in square brackets (i.e. [ABC]). You will be able to select Views you don't own from the list for viewing, but will not be able to make changes to those Views.</p>
<h3>Create New View</h3>
<p>To create a new View, you must specify a unique name for the View. You can copy an existing View by selecting it from the list. If you do not select a View to copy, your new View will get its settings from the default public View. Click <em>&quot;Add View&quot;</em> to create the new View; you will be taken to the form to View / Edit it.</p>
