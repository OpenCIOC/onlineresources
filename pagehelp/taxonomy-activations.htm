<p>The Taxonomy Activation Tool allows you to work with your activations across the entire Taxonomy at once, rather than having to individually edit Terms to change their activation. The interface is very similar to a drill-down search. There are three possible actions available for Terms: Activate, Deactivate, or Roll-up. The software only displays action icons for allowable activation states, and in many cases, you will not be able to change the state (such as for a Term that is in use by records).</p>

<p>The existing status us Terms is shown based on their appearance. In the standard software setup, this will include Inactive Terms being red, and an up-arrow icon appearing before rolled-up Terms. It is possible that your database may have different or additional styling applied to any of these states, so please use your local configuration as a guide.</p>

<p>The icons for changing the state of a Term appear at the end of the Term, and include a green checkbox to <img alt="Activate" class="style1" src="../images/greencheck.gif" /> Activate, a red X to <img alt="Deactivate" class="style1" src="../images/redx.gif" /> Deactivate, and an orange up-arrow to	<img alt="Roll-up" class="style1" src="../images/rollup.gif" /> Roll-up.</p>

<p class="Alert">Changes to activations take place immediately; no submission of your changes is required.</p>

<p>If you are working with a <strong>Preferred Term activations list</strong> you will see a <span class="ui-state-highlight">highlight style</span> applied to the code for Preferred Terms. Note that there is a separate tool for updating the list of Preferred Terms, available from the main Manage Taxonomy page.</p>

<p>If you are working in a multi-member database, depending on your permissions, you may be able to modify the activations at both a Global level (applying to all members in the database) and the Local level (applying only to your membership). When working with a local activation, you may Activate and Deactivate (not Roll-up) and you may only activate Terms that have been activated Globally.</p>
