<p>The <strong><em>&quot;Volunteer Community Groups&quot;</em></strong> page allows you to edit the list that will appear in the geographic legend on the search results page, showing which balls/icons match which areas. <em>Community Groups</em> are the link between a <em>Community Set</em> and the <em>Communities</em> that are then associated with an Opportunity record. With a Community Set, each Community must belong to exactly one <em>Community Group</em>, although the same Volunteer Community may be part of other Groups in other Sets. For that reason, you must add <em>Community Groups</em> to your database before you will be able to add Communities to your Set.</p>
<p>If you do not use many Communities, you may not need to group them together. In a case like this, it may make sense to set up one Community Group for each Community you want people to search with (it can have the same name as the Community); you will still need to assign that one Community to the Community Group, even if they have the same name.</p>
<p>If you need a further overview about the organization of Volunteer Communities, Community Sets, Community Groups, and Community Group Members, see the page help file on the main Volunteer Community administration page.</p>
<p>Within a <em>Community Set</em>, each <strong><em>&quot;Group Name&quot;</em></strong> must be unique; however, you could use the same Group Name again in a different Community Set.
<p>Community Groups are each associated with a coloured <strong><em>&quot;Ball&quot;</em></strong> <img src="../images/blue_ball.gif" width="12" height="12"> or other icon of your choice in the legend on search results pages. The number of the coloured balls is limited, and you can only use each colour once per Set. For that reason, there is a maximum total number of groups you can create (currently 11) unless you supply your own icons by providing an <strong><em>&quot;Image URL&quot;</em></strong>. Please note that having a large number of Groups is not a good idea, because the legend and list of icons will be overwhelming to users. Consider reorganizing your groups to have larger coverage areas instead.</p>
<h3>Editing an Existing Group</h3>
<p>There are no issues with re-organizing or renaming your Community Groups at any time, since no Community Group information is actually stored in your records. Only one Community Group can be updated at a time. Click the <em>&quot;Update&quot;</em> button to save your changes.</p>
<p>This form only allows you to edit the name of the group and the icon associated with that group; editing the specific <em>Communities</em> that are members of this group is done from the setup form for <em>Volunteer Community Group Members</em>.</p>
<h3>Adding a New Group</h3>
<p>The area to add a new <em>Community Group</em> is always the last entry on the page. Enter a unique name of the Community Group and the coloured ball icon you want to use in the search results legend from the drop-down and click <em>&quot;Add&quot;</em>.</p>
<h3>Removing a Group</h3>
<p>You can only delete a <em>Community Group</em> that isn't being used directly by any specific <em>Volunteer Community Group Members</em>. The <em>&quot;Delete&quot;</em> button will not be available beside communities that are being used. You will first need to reassign the Communities to another Group before the group value can be deleted.</p>
