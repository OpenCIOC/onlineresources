<p>The <strong><em>Manage Page Titles</em></strong> area are allows you to override the built-in title for a given page with a custom value. This option is only available for a limited number of pages at this time. This title appears in the title bar of your browser, as well as the title area of the header of the page (as specified in the Design Template).</p>
<p>To determine the page you want to edit, examine the location bar in your browser while viewing the page. Take the entire part of the address after the <strong>base</strong> address (as specified in general setup options). For example, your login page would be &quot;login.asp&quot; while this page would be &quot;admin/pagetitle&quot;. If the page you want to work on is not in the list, it is not currently possible to override the title. If needed, you may make a request to the CIOC developers via the <a href="http://community.cioc.ca/message-board/" target="_blank">CIOC Message Board</a> to add the page to the list of pages that can have a title override.</p>
