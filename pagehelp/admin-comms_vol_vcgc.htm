<p>The <strong><em>&quot;Volunteer Communities&quot;</em></strong> page allows you to edit the list of <em>Volunteer Communities</em> that will appear as criteria on your search pages, and in your Feedback/Entry Forms for the <em>&quot;Areas of Need&quot;/&quot;Number of Positions&quot; (NUM_NEEDED)</em> field. Note that this specifies the values for the search form and defaults on the entry forms, but you may add any Community in the database to your records even if they are not part of your Community Set.</p>
<p><em>Community Groups</em> are the link between a <em>Community Set</em> and the <em>Communities</em> that are then associated with an Opportunity record. With a Community Set, each Community must belong to exactly one <em>Community Group</em>, although the same Volunteer Community may be part of other Groups in other Sets. For that reason, you must add <em>Community Groups</em> to your database before you will be able to add Communities to your Set.</p>
<p>If you do not use many Communities, you may not need to group them together. In a case like this, it may make sense to set up one Community Group for each Community you want people to search with (it can have the same name as the Community); you will still need to assign that one Community to the Community Group, even if they have the same name.</p>
<p>If you need a further overview about the organization of Volunteer Communities, Community Sets, Community Groups, and Community Group Members, see the page help file on the main Volunteer Community administration page.</p>
<p class="Alert">Note: the global list of Communities is a shared resource also used by the Community Information module and is edited under the shared list of classification systems from the main setup page.</p>
<h3>Editing an Existing Community</h3>
<p>The only change you can make to an existing community is to change the <em>Community Group</em> it belongs to. If you must change a <em>Community</em> being used, you need to add the new Community, and remove reference to the old Community.</p>
<p>Only one community can be updated at a time. Click the <em>&quot;Update&quot;</em> button to save your changes.</p>
<h3>Adding a New Community</h3>
<p>The area to add a new community is always the last entry on the page. Select a name of the <em>Community</em> and the <em>Community Group</em> you want it to belong to from the drop-downs and click <em>&quot;Add&quot;</em>.</p>
<h3>Removing a Community</h3>
<p>When you <em>&quot;Delete&quot;</em> a Community from this list of Group Members, you will not change the data found in any Opportunity records. Therefore, the option to delete from this list is always available. Once a Community is deleted from the list of Group Members, it will cease to be available on any forms for this Community Set <strong>unless</strong> the Opportunity record already has data for the Community in the <em>&quot;Areas of Need&quot;/&quot;Number of Positions&quot; (NUM_NEEDED)</em> field.</p>
