<p>The <strong><em>Prepare Update Email Request</em></strong> page allows you to prepare (and customize if you choose) an Email Update Request to be mailed to one or many organizations or contacts.</p>
<p>If you are sending out a <em>single</em> update request, the text that will appear at the top of the page will indicate the record number that you are sending the request to (this also serves as a link to the record details), as well as information about when you last sent an update email to the organization or contact. If you are sending out a <em>bulk</em> update request to a number of organizations or contacts, the information at the top of the page will indicate how many records you are preparing the update email for.</p>
<h3>Changing the Default Message Text</h3>
<p>If you have multiple Standard Email Update Text values for this type of message, you may select another default message from the drop-down at the top of the page. Click the <em>&quot;Change Message&quot;</em> button to update the page with your selection.</p>
<h3>Viewing and Customizing the Message Text</h3>
<p>The <em>&quot;Current Message&quot;</em> section of the page shows you the email that will be sent out if you choose not to customize the message. The text within the message contained in square brackets such as [RECORD ORGANIZATION NAME] will be automatically filled in by the software when the email is sent. The bottom section of the page, <em>&quot;Editable Sections&quot;,</em> allows you to customize the subject and the top portion of the body of the email that will be sent out.</p>
<h3>Changing the View Used for Record Links</h3>
<p>If you have multiple public Views, you may have the choice of sending out the update request with links to a particular View. If you have a special domain name associated with a View, you will see that URL next to the View name.</p>
<h3>Previewing the Message</h3>
<p>Once you are happy with the email message to be sent out, click on the <em>&quot;Preview the Email Message&quot;</em> button at the bottom of the page to move to the next page where you can view the message to be sent out prior to emailing.</p>
