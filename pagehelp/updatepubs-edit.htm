<p>This page is used to edit the <strong>Publication Description</strong> and manage the list of <strong>General Headings</strong> from the current Publication for the selected record. If you are working in a <em>Limited (Publication) View</em>, you will only be allowed to update the <em>Description</em> and <em>Headings</em> from the Publication associated with your View. Otherwise, your changes on this page apply to whichever Publication you have chosen to work with.</p>
<h4>Data Management</h4>
<p>Because Publication updates can occur independent of other record updates, Publication data has its own data management information (<em>Last Modified</em> and <em>Modified By</em>) that is tracked automatically by the system.</p>
<h4>Descriptions</h4>
<p>Use this field to add a special description for the current Publication. The description applies to the current Publication only, and would be removed if the Publication is removed from this record. If using the bilingual software, a French description fields will also be available. From within the setup screens for the current Publication, the Publication Description can be configured as a regular display field, given a custom name, and added to the record details or feedback forms for any View.</p>
<h3>General Headings</h3>

<h4>What are General Headings?</h4>
<p>General Headings allow you to classify records within a Publication. In Publication-based Views, Headings may be used to create the "Quick List" search on the basic search form. Headings are also searchable from the Advanced Search form in any View that has access to that Publication. Records must be first assigned to a Publication before they can be indexed to that Publication's General Headings. To create new General Headings for this Publication, use the &quot;Publications&quot; link in the side menu of the application start page or from the Setup menu (assuming you have permissions to do so). Then return to this page and those Headings will be available for adding to this record.</p>
<p>Some Headings may be <em>unused</em> and intended for print indexes only, or Taxonomy-based (applied according to the Service Categories indexed to the record) and are not available for adding to records. If there are Headings available to add to the record for this Publication, you will have the options to:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Remove existing Headings</strong> by unchecking the checkbox beside the Heading(s) under &quot;Existing Headings&quot;</li>
	<li><strong>Add new Headings</strong> by selecting from the checkboxes in the &quot;Add New Headings&quot; section.</li>
</ul>
