<p>On the <em><strong>Send Email Update Request</strong></em> page, the software will attempt to send the Email Update Request(s) you have created. The software will report any known issues with sending the message(s) and print a report of the email addresses and record numbers that were successfully sent. For example:</p>
<p>Email sent to: myaddress1@mysite.com (ACT0001)
<br>Email sent to: myaddress2@anothersite.ca (ACT0002)
<br>Email sent to: myaddress3@thatplace.ca (ACT0003)</p>
<p><span class="Alert">It is recommended that you print this page</span>, as it provides you with the only record of emails successfully sent.</p>
<p><span class="Alert">Note</span>: it is still possible for an email delivery to fail even though the system was able to create the email message; you should receive a &quot;bounce-back&quot; email message in this situation, but you will generally not be notified if the message was caught in a spam filter.</p>
