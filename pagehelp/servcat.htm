<p>The <em>Browse by Service Category</em> search is a simplified drill-down type of Taxonomy search, allowing you to locate a Service Category (Taxonomy Term). This search type can be made available to the public. This search can be accessed from the main search page of the software, but you can also be directed to this search from the search results page after a previous <em>Browse by Service Category</em> search or by clicking on a Term from the public version of the <em>Service Categories</em> field on the record details page. This search page will only show a Term if the Term or its <em>Sub-Topics</em> have associated Organization / Program records in your View.</p>
<p>When you first access <em>Browse by Service Category</em> from the start page, you will see a list of top-level Terms. You cannot search on any of these very general top-level Terms; you must instead select one of the general topics and display its Sub-Topics. You can do this by clicking on the Term name, or the <em>&quot;Sub-Topics&quot;</em> link.</p>
<p>While viewing a list of Terms other than the top-level Terms, you will have the opportunity to perform a search on the Term, or bring up a list of the Term's <em>Sub-Topics</em> or <em>Related Topics</em> if they are available. If you click the <em>View Programs and Services</em> link, you will return a list of all the Organization / Program records that are associated with this term <strong>or any of its Sub-Topics</strong>.</p>
<p>The Search Menu will tell you which Terms you are currently looking at (e.g. &quot;Sub-Topics of Basic Needs&quot;, &quot;Topics Related to Information and Referral&quot;), and depending on your current page, will allow you to navigate back to the top-level list of Terms, to a higher level of Terms, or to execute a search for a Related or higher-level Term. If you see a record count next to a link, this indicates that you can click on the link to execute a search for Organization / Program records.</p>
<p>After executing your search for Organization / Program records, you will see some additional search options and a menu to return to various <em>Browse by Service Category</em> search pages.</p>
