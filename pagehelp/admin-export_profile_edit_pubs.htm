<p>The <em>Manage Export Publication Codes</em> page allows you to select which Publication codes will be included in the <em>Publication</em> field of the records you export. To add a new Publication to the list, select it from the drop-down list at the bottom of the form and select the <em>&quot;Add&quot;</em> button. It is possible that there will be no Publication codes available to select from this page if none exist within your application. After adding the Publication Code, you can remove it by clicking the <em>&quot;Delete&quot;</em> button next to the Publication code.</p>
<p>For each Publication you select, you have the option of including any Descriptions or General Headings associated with the Publication. Check or uncheck the boxes indicating whether you want to include Descriptions or General Headings for a Publication and click the <em>&quot;Update&quot;</em> button to save your changes. You must process changes to each Publication one at a time.</p>
<p><span class="Alert">Important Note</span>: Selecting particular <em>Publication</em> codes for your profiles <strong>does not</strong> impact which records you will be exporting, only the contents of the <em>Publication</em> field you are sending. Records to send are selected at the time of export.</p>
