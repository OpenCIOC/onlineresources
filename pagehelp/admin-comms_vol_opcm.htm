<p>The <strong><em>Volunteer Opportunity Community Set Management</em></strong> tool allows you to review the assignment of <em>Volunteer Opportunities</em> to specific <em>Community Sets</em> and add or remove a number of Opportunities from a Set at once. This is a <strong>very important tool</strong>, since even Super Users do not otherwise have the ability to change the Community Set assignment of records not in any of the <em>Views</em> they can access.</p>
<p>The first page of the tool, the Status page, shows a table with a list of the <em>Community Sets</em> in the database. The table indicates how many <em>Volunteer Opportunities</em> have been assigned to each set and how many are left out. The counts for deleted and expired opportunities are separate, and highlighted in the <em class="Alert">Alert</em> colour. An <strong>Edit</strong> button next to each Community Set links to a page to find Opportunities to Add or Remove from the Set.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the Status page, you may see an <em>Alert</em>-coloured message indicating that you have orphaned Opportunities - ones that have not been assigned to any set. If they are deleted or expired records, this is not a major concern, however you should take care not to leave orphaned any Opportunities that are not deleted or expired. &quot;Orphans&quot; can easily be identified in the last page of this tool during the <em>Add</em> process, as they will have no value for their existing Community Sets.</p>
<p>In a multi-member database, you may see reference to <em>&quot;Local&quot;</em> records (ones owned by your membership) and <em>&quot;Shared&quot;</em> records (ones owned by other members in your database). If records have been shared with you by other members, you may add those records to your community sets to make them available in your Views.</p>
