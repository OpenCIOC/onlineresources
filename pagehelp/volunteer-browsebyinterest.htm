<p>The <em>Browse by Area of Interest</em> page allows you to review volunteer opportunities that have been categorized under a <em>Specific</em> Area of Interest. This page lists all Areas of Interest beginning with the letter chosen from the <em>&quot;Select a Letter&quot;</em> menu. It is also possible to list all Areas alphabetically on a single page using the <em>&quot;Show All&quot;</em> link.</p>
<p>At the end of each <em>Area of Interest</em>, the number of records in the current View that contain that term is identified in brackets. Clicking on a specific Area of Interest name produces a list of current Opportunities in your View that contain that <em>Area of Interest</em>.</p>
<p>If the message that appears on this page is: <em>&quot;Found 0 matches&quot;</em>, then there are no <em>Areas of Interest</em> in the database that begin with the letter chosen. In this case, use the <em>&quot;Select a Letter&quot;</em> menu to choose a different starting letter. Alternatively, return to the main menu using the <em>&quot;New Search&quot;</em> button or your browser's back button and begin a new search.</p>
<p>A Super User can add to the list of Areas of Interest by going to the <em>Checklists &gt; Specific Areas of Interest</em>. It is important to make sure that all Volunteer Opportunity records are assigned to appropriate Areas of Interest so they can be found in searches.</p>
