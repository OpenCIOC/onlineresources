<p>The management pages for Standard Email Update Text values allow you to customize sections of the email update request messages. You may create several different pre-defined texts for each type of message (Community Information Organization/Program update, Volunteer Opportunity update, Volunteer Organization update for &quot;All Opportunities&quot;). One message for each type must be designated as the default; the default message will be the one initially selected when you create a new Email Update Request. If you have multiple Email Update Text values, you will have an opportunity to make a choice between them at the time of sending.</p>
<h3>Add a New Email Text</h3>
<p>To create a new Email Text for the current message type (Community Information Organization/Program update, Volunteer Opportunity update, Volunteer Organization update for &quot;All Opportunities&quot;), click on the <em>&quot;Add Standard Email Text&quot;</em> button. Optionally, you may copy an existing text.</p>
<h3>Edit an Existing Email Text</h3>
<p>To edit an existing Email Text, select it from the drop-down and click <em>&quot;View/Edit Standard Email Text&quot;</em>. Note that each type of message (Community Information Organization/Program 	update, Volunteer Opportunity update, Volunteer Organization update for &quot;All Opportunities&quot;) is managed separately, and available from a different link on the main setup page of the software.</p>
<h3>Changing the Default Value</h3>
<p>To change which text is the default for the database, you must go into the text that you want to make the default and click the appropriate checkbox.</p>
