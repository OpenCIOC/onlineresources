<p>This report identifies branches on which more than one Term is Active. It is recommended that each branch be activated at only one level; in other words, you should not have a Term and its Child or Parent Term Active simultaneously.</p>

<p>This tool provides a report only, and unlike the other Activation Tools cannot make any changes to your Activations. You will see a list of Terms sorted by Code, Term Names in the current language, the number of records using the Term, an edit icon <img src="../images/edit.gif" alt="Edit" /> linked to the edit form for the Term, and a search icon <img src="../images/zoom.gif" alt="Search" /> that will allow you to bring up a list of the records using the Term.</p>

<p>To optimize the usefulness of this report, fix your activations starting at the top level first. Having a second level Term active, for instance, can cause a large number of Terms to appear in the report.</p>
