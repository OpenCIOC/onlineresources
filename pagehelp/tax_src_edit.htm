<p>Each Taxonomy Term can be associated with a <em>Source</em> which is meant to represent where the term originated from (i.e. &quot;INFO LINE &quot; or &quot;Local&quot;). This is a general explanation of where the term originated from, unlike the <em>Modified By</em> information that indicates a particular person who last made modifications to the Term. This page allows you to add new source values, as well as edit or delete existing values. Use the <em>&quot;Return to Manage Taxonomy&quot;</em> link at top of page to return to thesaurus management main page.</p>
<p><span class="Alert">Note</span>: Values on this page can only be added, updated and deleted one row at a time. Remember to use the &quot;Action&quot; buttons beside each row after each change is made before making a change to another row or adding another value.</p>
<h4>Add a New Source</h4>
<p>Type the name you wish to use as the Source for Taxonomy Terms into the bottom most text entry box on the page and click the <em>&quot;Add&quot;</em> Button.</p>
<h4>Edit an Existing Source</h4>
<p>Make the required changes to the Source you wish to edit on the page and click the <em>&quot;Update&quot;</em> button beside that value.</p>
<h4>Delete an Existing Source</h4>
<p>Click the <em>&quot;Delete&quot;</em> button beside the value you wish to delete. You will not be able to delete values that are currently in use by Taxonomy Term(s).</p>
