<p><strong><em>Template Layouts</em></strong> are used within <em>Design Templates</em> to control the layout of customizable parts of the page, including headers, footers, and main page search forms and content.</p>
<p>Layouts that are exclusively controlled by a particular Agency have that Agency Code at the end of the name in square brackets (i.e. [ABC]). You will be able to select Layouts that you don't own from the list for viewing, but will not be able to make changes to those Layouts.</p>
<p>You will have one or more built-in system Layouts in your database for each type (Header, Footer, Search). You can view or copy these built-in Layouts, and use them in your Templates if desired, but they cannot be edited in any way. System Layouts are denoted with a *.</p>
<h3>Edit an Existing Template Layout</h3>
<p>Select the name of the Layout that you wish to edit from the drop-down menu and click the <em>&quot;View / Edit Template Layout&quot;</em> button.</p>
<h3>Add a New Template Layout</h3>
<p>To create a new Layout, click the <em>&quot;Add Template Layout&quot;</em> button to be taken to a new Layout data entry form. You can copy an existing Layout by selecting it from the copy drop-down list. If you do not select a Layout to copy, your new Layout will be blank (empty).</p>
