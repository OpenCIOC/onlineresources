<p>It is recommended that you periodically clear the database of old referrals that you do not require anymore. You should select an appropriate cut-off date for removing old referrals, such as your previous year-end for reporting to funders.</p>
<h4>Before Deleting</h4>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Make sure you have a full backup</strong> of your referral statistics and data (such as through a saved download). Having a full data backup will allow you to reproduce statistical reports offline if it were required.</li>
	<li><strong>Consult any and all Volunteer data partners</strong> and confirm the plan to remove old statistics. Statistics removal is not confined to any particular View or Agency, it will remove <strong>all</strong> statistics in the given module up to the period of the selected date.</li>
	<li><strong>Save and/or print</strong> any statistical reports you think you might want for the time segment you are deleting.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Deleting the Referrals</h4>
<p>On this page there is a table with two columns. The column on the left is the &quot;Delete Up To and Including&quot; column, with dates and radio buttons for selecting a date. The column on the right lists the number of referrals that would be deleted if you select that particular date.</p>
<p>To delete referrals, click in the radio button for the month that you want to select. This will delete all referrals for the selected month, and everything prior to that month. So if you selected March 2006, then all referrals that occurred during or before March 2006 would be permanently deleted.</p>
<p><span class="Alert">Important Note</span>: once referrals have been deleted, they are permanently deleted and can not be restored without a backup and the assistance of a system administrator. It is a good idea to keep a backup of your daily download, so that if you ever want to refer to older referrals you will have them in your daily download file.</p>
