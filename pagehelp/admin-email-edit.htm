<p>The management pages for Standard Email Update Text values allow you to customize sections of the email update request messages. You may create several different pre-defined texts for each type of message Community Information Organization/Program update, Volunteer Opportunity update, Volunteer Organization update for &quot;All Opportunities&quot;). One message for each type must be designated as the default; the default message will be the one initially selected when you create a new Email Update Request. If you have multiple Email Update Text values, you will have an opportunity to make a choice between them at the time of sending.</p>
<h3>Changing Values at the Time of Sending</h3>
<p>The <em>&quot;Subject&quot;</em> and <em>&quot;Message Body&quot;</em> values can be altered at the time messages are sent; if you change these values here, it will change the default values. All other setup items can only be altered from this setup screen.</p>
<h3>Links to Record pages</h3>
<p>Depending on the type of message, you will either have a <em>&quot;Detail Link&quot;</em> and a <em>&quot;Feedback Link&quot;</em> or an <em>&quot;All Opportunities Link&quot;</em> and a <em>&quot;Suggest Opportunity Link&quot;</em>. If you prefer, you can decide to include only one of either the <em>&quot;Detail Link&quot;</em> or <em>&quot;Feedback Link&quot;</em> in your message. To remove the link you do not want to use, leave the description of that link blank; you cannot leave both descriptions blank, however. <span class="Alert">Note</span>: if a record is not available in the View you are sending out the request for (this could be either the Default View or some other publicly-accessible View you have chosen), the system <em>automatically</em> generates only a <em>Feedback Link</em> using a pre-determined description.</p>
<h3>Changing the Default Message</h3>
<p>To change which text is the default for the database, you must go into the text that you want to make the default and click the <em>&quot;</em><label><em>Make this the default message of this type</em></label>&quot; checkbox.</p>
