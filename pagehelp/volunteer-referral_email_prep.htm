<p>The <strong><em>&quot;Prepare Referral Follow-Up Email&quot;</em></strong> page allows you to prepare a customized email to be mailed to one or many Organizations or potential Volunteers regarding one or more referral requests.</p>
<p>The text at the top of the page lists Opportunities, potential Volunteers, and dates of the Referrals for which an email will be sent.</p>
<p>If you are sending emails to an Organization about multiple referrals, one email will be sent to each contact at the Organization about any referrals for Opportunities where they are listed as the contact. This email will summarize the information for all selected Referrals for which they are the contact on the Opportunity. If you are sending emails about multiple Referral requests to the volunteer a separate email will be sent for each Referral request, even if the volunteer has requested a Referral for multiple different Opportunities.</p>
<p>The bottom section of the page, <em>&quot;Current Message&quot;</em>, requires you to set the subject and the top portion of the body of the email that will be sent out. You can also enter closing remarks for the message.</p>
<p>Once you are happy with the Email message to be sent out, click on the <em>&quot;Preview the Email Message&quot;</em> button at the bottom of the page to move to the next page where you can preview the message to be sent out prior to Emailing.</p>
