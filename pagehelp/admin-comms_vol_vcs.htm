<p><strong><em>Community Sets</em></strong> allow you to take a selection of <em>Communities</em> and <em>Volunteer Opportunities</em> and make them available in a particular View. You can use a <em>Community Set</em> for multiple different Views, but each View can only have one Community Set.</p>
<p>Each Community Set must have a unique <strong><em>Set Name</em></strong>. The <em>Set Name</em> is visible on data entry forms if you have more than one Set, and is visible as a list of Sets the record belongs to if you have added the Community Set field to the Record Details page in your View. It is used in the <em>View Setup Form</em> to pick the Community Set used for the View, and on the <em>Update Form</em> and <em>Volunteer Opportunity Community Set Management Tool</em> to assign a record to one or more Sets.</p>
<p>The <strong><em>Area Served</em></strong> is seen on the main menu page (<em>&quot;Looking for Opportunities in...&quot;</em>) and on the page <em>Search: Step 1</em>. Many different Community Sets can use the same value for their <em>Area Served</em>.</p>
<p>Some databases will only need to have one Community Set. You need more than one Community Set if:</p>
<ul>
	<li>You want to list different geographic areas in different Views (such as on search forms), and/or</li>
	<li>You want different sets of records in different Views (not including showing/hiding non-public and deleted records, etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>To modify an existing Set, make your changes and click <strong>Update</strong> next to the Community Set you have changed. You can only change one Community Set at a time. To add a new Set, enter your values at the bottom of the form and click <strong>Add</strong>. You will only see the option to <strong>Delete</strong> a Community Set if it is not being used by a View or Opportunity.</p>
