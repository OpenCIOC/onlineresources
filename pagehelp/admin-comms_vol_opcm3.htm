<p>This page contains the results of your search on the previous screen of the Community Set management tool. From this page, you can select the checkboxes next to a record or group of records and add or remove it from the <em>Community Set</em> you are working with using the button at the bottom of the form.</p>
<p>You will be able to see the <em>Alert Column</em>, <em>Position Title</em>, <em>Organization Name</em>, and existing <em>Community Set</em> classification of the records in your results. If an Opportunity Record is <strong>available in your current View</strong>, it will be linked to open the Record Details in another window. You cannot see the full details of records not in your current View, so where possible it is helpful to change your View to optimize your ability to review the full details of the records you are attempting to add or remove.</p>
