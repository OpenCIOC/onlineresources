<p class="Alert">These instructions are shared by several different types of searches, including the Main Page (Basic) Search, Advanced Search, New Results Set (using checkboxes to create a new list of records), Previous Search Results, Taxonomy Search, and various &quot;Browse&quot; searches. Not all features exist for all searches; see notes in each section if applicable.</p>
<p>The <em>Search Results</em> page displays records that match the criteria you entered from one of the aforementioned types of searches. If the message that appears on this page is: <em>&quot;There are no records that match your criteria&quot;</em>, then there are no records in the database that match the criteria you chose. In this case, use your back button or return to the Main Menu / Start Page or Advanced Search page and begin a new search that is less restrictive.</p>
<p>The <em>Browse by Organization</em> page works like other search pages in the database, except your &quot;search&quot; is to select records beginning with a particular letter or number. Select the letter or number you wish to display to return records that begin with that letter / number.</p>
<p>Each record in your search results will have a link to view the full <strong>Record Details</strong>. The link will be found on either the <em>Organization Name</em> or <em>Record Number</em>. Whether the name or record number is linked is determined by your <em>Display Options</em>, discussed below.</p>

<h3>About Your Search</h3>
<p>Most searches include a description of your search at the top of the page. From <em>Advanced Search</em>, the default is that the details of your search are <em>not</em> included, but you can check a box at the bottom of the search form to have the details of your search printed on the results page. When the details of your search are available, the information can be used to describe your search when you <em>Refine Your Search</em>, when you view your list of <em>Recent Searches</em>, and when you <em>Save Your Search</em>.</p>

<a name="refine"></a>
<h3>Refine Your Search</h3>
<p>Clicking the <img border="0" src="../images/zoom.gif" width="17" height="14">&nbsp;<em>Refine Search</em> link at the top of your search results will send the current search criteria to the <em>Advanced Search</em> form so that you can add additional criteria to search within the current results.</p>

<a name="map"></a>
<h3>Mapping Your Results</h3>
<p>The <strong><em><img src="../images/globe.gif" width="16" height="14"> Map Results</em></strong> feature allows you to generate a dynamic map showing the location of your search results. <span class="Alert">This feature is available for all types of searches except &quot;Browse by Organization&quot;</span>. You can perform a number of functions when in map mode, including:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Resize your map window</strong> by dragging the bar between the map and your search results or record details. The software will remember your map size on subsequent searches.</li>
	<li><strong>Move your map window</strong> to the side or bottom of your screen by clicking the appropriately labelled button at the bottom right of the map.</li>
	<li><strong>Close the map</strong> by clicking the <em>Close</em> button at the bottom right of the map.</li>
	<li><strong>View a legend</strong> indicating which map pin colours indicate which categories of records. This is only available if you have provided category names to the various pin colours through the mapping category setup.</li>
	<li><strong>Zoom in and out</strong> by moving the zoom slider in the upper left of the map up and down, or scrolling up and down with your mouse wheel. You can get to your original zoom level by clicking the hand icon in the middle of the positioning circle at the top left of the map.</li>
	<li><strong>Reposition the map</strong> by using the positioning circle in the upper left of the map and clicking the up, down, left or right icons. You can also reposition using your mouse by grabbing and dragging the map: click and hold your left mouse button, move your mouse to reposition the map, and then drop the map into its new position by releasing the mouse button.</li>
	<li><strong>Change the type of map</strong> from a standard map into a satellite or hybrid (satellite + map data) view by clicking the appropriate button in the upper right corner of the map.</li>
	<li><strong>Identify which records are currently visible on the map</strong>. Records with no map location will not have a map pin; records that can be mapped but are not in the current Viewport will lose their map pin colour (for example from red <img src="../images/mapping/mm_1_red_20.png" width="12" height="20">: to white: <img src="../images/mapping/mm_0_white_20.png" width="12" height="20">)</li>
	<li><strong>Locate a specific record</strong> on the map by clicking the map pin in your search results, or locate a specific record in the results list by clicking on an icon on the map. The map pin of the record will change and be highlighted, and your results list will scroll to the record so that it occurs at the top of the screen. On the map, a call-out will appear with the records name and a link to the record details.</li>
	<li><strong>Create a new set of search results based on proximity</strong> by zooming into the area you wish to search, and clicking <em>Check all in Viewport</em>. You must have the <em>Select Checkbox</em> option enabled in your <a href="#display">display options</a> to use this feature. A new map will be generated after generate a new results list by selecting <em>New Results Set</em> from the drop-down menu.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../images/mapping/mm_home.png" width="23" height="39" align="left" hspace="5" title="home icon"> If you have performed a <em>Located Near</em> search, your location will be specified on the map with the home icon. This icon can sometimes be hidden by other icons representing your search results. Note that in order for this icon to appear, you must have either requested records within a certain distance (e.g. &quot;within 5km&quot;) <em>or</em> specified that your results sort by <em>proximity</em>, such that nearer records occur first.</p>
<p>Your map will persist as you navigate through various record details pages within your search results, but will be removed if you leave your search by clicking a regular menu selection.</p>
<p>To enable the <em>Map Results</em> link in your search results, you must turn it on in your current View, and if you database is hosted using a domain name other than cioc.ca, you must also contact the CIOC Technical administrators to create and configure a Google API key for your domain. The ability to map individual records is determined by whether those records have been geocoded (a process which stores the latitude and longitude of the location in the database). You can add the geocoding field to your update forms through your View setup.</p>

<a name="subjects"></a>
<h3>Subject Sidebar</h3>
<p>If you are using the <strong>Thesaurus</strong> in your <em>View</em> and you performed a Basic or Advanced keyword search in <em>&quot;Keywords&quot;</em> or <em>&quot;Subjects&quot;</em>, you will also see a <em>&quot;Subject Sidebar&quot;</em> menu on the left margin of your screen. This menu lists terms from the Subject Thesaurus based on your search terms. Clicking on subject links in this sidebar may take you to other records of interest.</p>
<p>Note that you can hide the subjects sidebar by clicking on the <em>&quot;Hide Subjects&quot;</em> link at the top of the menu.</p>

<a name="display"></a>
<h3>Record List Display Options</h3>
<p>All users with a login into the database have the option of changing the way their search results are displayed. The exact options you have available to you for your display will be determined by your permissions in the database. You can change your display options temporarily for your session, or save your changes as your default to use every time you log into the database. To change your settings, click the <em>Change Display Options</em> link; a pop-up window will appear that allows you to modify your current settings. Note that your changes will not be reflected until you perform a new search, or refresh your current search results page.</p>

<a name="fields"></a>
<h4>Show Fields</h4>
<p><em>Show Fields</em> allows you to decide what information from your records will be shown in your results. You may select from a set of predefined fields, as well as choose an unlimited number of &quot;Custom&quot; fields. The list of Custom fields available to you is determined by what information you are allowed to see from the <em>Record Details</em> page.</p>
<p>The <em>Alert Column</em> is a special box that appears on the far left of your search results. Your permissions dictate whether you will be able to see the Alert Column, and which alerts you are allowed to see. The following are a list of the available alerts:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong><span class="Alert">Alert Coloured</span> Box</strong> - When the alert column is coloured , the record is non-public</li>
	<li><strong>C</strong> - Record has <strong>C</strong>omments or an Internal Memo</li>
	<li><strong>F</strong> - Record has <strong>F</strong>eedback</li>
	<li><strong>P</strong> - Record is <strong>P</strong>ending deletion (a deletion date set in the future)</li>
	<li><strong>S</strong> - Record has been <strong>S</strong>hared with you by another CIOC Member in your database</li>
	<li><strong>V</strong> - Record has <strong>V</strong>olunteer Opportunities</li>
	<li><strong>X</strong> - Record has been deleted</li>
</ul>

<a name="options"></a>
<h4>Show Options</h4>
<p><em>Show Options</em> will provide you direct links to perform various types of operations on your list of records. The exact options available to you will depend on your permissions.</p>
<p>The <em>Select Checkbox</em> option is used to perform operations on many records at once. A checkbox will appear beside each record in your results, allowing you to select the records you want and perform operations on them. Some options (depending on your permissions) include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Create a new results set from selected records</li>
	<li>Create a new reminder for the selected records</li>
	<li>Print a list of records</li>
	<li>Generate a printable map for a list of records</li>
	<li>Create usage statistics reports</li>
	<li>Bulk Email Update Request</li>
	<li>Set the Public status for the selected records</li>
	<li>Delete / Restore Records</li>
	<li>Change the owner of the selected records</li>
	<li>Add or remove Distributions, Headings, NAICS codes, Publications, Subjects, and Taxonomy Terms</li>
	<li>Perform Find &amp; Replace operations</li>
	<li>Update Geo-coding (for mapping)</li>
	<li>Export Records</li>
	<li>Add the selected records to a Sharing Profile to make it available to another CIOC Member in your database</li>
</ul>

<a name="sort"></a>
<h4>Sort by</h4>
<p>This section allows you to change the order in which records are listed. You may select from one of the pre-defined sort options, or a custom choice from the drop-down list.</p>
<p>A sort by <em>Relevancy</em> only works when you have performed a full-text keyword search; a Relevancy sort option will try to determine which records are a better match to your list of keywords, and place those first in the list.</p>
<p>A sort by <em>Proximity</em> is never available as a selection from your display options; it is only available as an option when performing a <em>Located Near</em> search. Proximity sorting overrides whatever other sort option has been selected. Proximity sorting is automatically carried through when you generate a <em>New Results Set</em> from a set of search results that are sorted by Proximity.</p>

<a name="print"></a>
<h3>Print Version</h3>
<p>If you want to print a report of your search results, clicking the <em>Print Version</em> link (next to <em>Change Display Options</em>) will allow you to see a report of your results formatted for printing, without the menu and extra links. The Super User of the database can customize this print version and optimize it for printing by creating a special <em>Design Template</em> just for printing, and adding it to the current <em>View</em>.</p>

<a name="save"></a>
<h3>Save This Search</h3>
<p>To save your search criteria to your list of saved searches, click the <em>&quot;Save This Search&quot;</em> link. Helpful Hint: If the details of your search are displayed at the top of the page, they will be carried over to the notes field of your search.</p>
<p class="Alert">This feature is not available when performing a &quot;Browse&quot; search, or when working with a &quot;New Results Set&quot; or viewing &quot;Previous Search Results&quot;.</p>
