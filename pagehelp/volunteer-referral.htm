<h3>Creating Referrals</h3>
<p><span class="Alert">Note</span>: New Referrals are created through a button on the <em>Record Details</em> page of the Opportunity. There are two ways a new Referral might be created:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Yes, I'd Like to Volunteer Button</strong> - Public and staff without permission to <em>Manage Volunteer Referrals</em> use this method to create a new Referral. Only the contact information for the Volunteer and the Volunteer's own notes for the Organization can be entered using this form.</li>
	<li><strong>Create Referral Button</strong> - Super Users always see this option. Staff with a User Type that has the <em>Can Manage Referrals</em> permission will be allowed to create new referrals for records owned by their own Agency. This Referral form is the full edit form for Referrals, and staff can decide whether or not to send out notification Emails to the Volunteer and Contact Person for the Opportunity.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Find a Referral</h3>
<p>There are currently two types of predefined reports you can use to list Referrals in the database. In addition, you can perform a custom search referrals using the form provided on this page. Most users will only see Referrals that are created for records owned by their own Agency; Super Users see all Referrals, regardless of the Agency that owns the associated Opportunity record.</p>
<p>You can list <strong>Opportunities Requiring Follow-up</strong>; this list includes all flagged Opportunities, regardless of the date on which they were created or modified. All new referrals created by Volunteers using the <em>Yes, I'd Like to Volunteer</em> button are automatically flagged for follow-up.</p>
<p>You can list <strong>Opportunities Modified in the Past [X] Days</strong>; this list includes all Opportunities created or modified in the past [X] number of days.</p>
<h4>Custom Referral Search</h4>
<p>The following types of search parameters are available using the <em>Custom Referral Search</em> form:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Referral Date</strong>: <em>On or after the date</em>: Enter the date you wish to be the first day to include the search results. This date <em>is</em> included in the results. <em>Before the date</em>: Enter the date you wish to be one day after the last date you wish to include in the search results. This date is <em>not</em> included in the results. To generate a report for exactly the previous month, click the &quot;First of Last Month&quot; and &quot;First of This Month&quot; buttons.</li>
	<li><strong>Modified Date</strong>: <em>On or after the date</em>: Enter the date you wish to be the first day to include the search results. This date <em>is</em> included in the results. <em>Before the date</em>: Enter the date you wish to be one day after the last date you wish to include in the search results. This date is <em>not</em> included in the results. To generate a report for exactly the previous month, click the &quot;First of Last Month&quot; and &quot;First of This Month&quot; buttons.</li>
	<li><strong>Organization Keywords</strong>: You can include keywords or &quot;quoted phrases&quot; from the Organization name to locate Referrals for specific Organizations.</li>
	<li><strong>Position Title Keywords</strong>: You can include keywords or &quot;quoted phrases&quot; from the Position Title to locate Referrals for specific Positions.</li>
	<li><strong>Volunteer Name</strong>: You can include all or part of a volunteer's name to locate a specific volunteer's Referrals.</li>
	<li><strong>Follow-Up</strong>: You can search for records with a specific follow-up flag state. <em>Any</em> will show all records regardless of flag state, <em>Required</em> will select only referrals that are flagged as requiring follow-up and <em>Not Required</em> will select only referrals that are <em>not</em> flagged as requiring follow-up.</li>
	<li><strong>Records owned by</strong>: If there is more than one record owner in the database, you can specify here to return results based on this criteria.</li>
