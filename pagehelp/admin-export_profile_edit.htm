<p>This page allows you to edit the details of an Export Profile, including which data elements will be included, and in which View(s) it can be accessed.</p>
<h3>General Profile Setup</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Language</strong> - specify the record language(s) to be exported (currently only English and/or French may be selected for export).</li>
	<li><strong>Profile Name</strong> - unique name for the Profile. Used to select the profile during the export process.</li>
	<li><strong>Source Database Info</strong> - specify a name for your database, a link to your database or website, and the publicly-accessible View to which you would like the recipient to submit change requests for the records (this will create a link to the feedback form in that View).</li>
	<li><strong>Privacy Profiles</strong> - if you use privacy profiles in your database, select whether the recipient is allowed to have access to private information. <span class="Alert">If in doubt, <em>do not</em> include private information!</span></li>
	<li><strong>In Views</strong> - To make this Export Profile available for use, you must enable it in one or more Views. For security reasons, it is recommended that you only activate each profile in the View(s) in which it will be needed.</li>
</ul>
<h3>&quot;Include Data&quot;: Managing the Data Elements for the Profile</h3>
<p>The data elements that will be included in the profile are edited via a series of pop-up windows linked from this form. Changes made in the pop-up windows are processed independently from the rest of the information in the form. This section allows you to pick fields, distribution, and publication data to include, but it does not specify which records are included. <strong>Records must be selected at the time of export, and will be determined in part by the View the user is in.</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Manage Fields</strong> - select which database fields will be included.</li>
	<li><strong>Manage Distributions</strong> - select which Distribution codes will be included in the <em>Distribution</em> field.</li>
	<li><strong>Manage Publications</strong> - select which Publication codes will be included in the <em>Publication</em> field. You will also be able to choose whether to include related <em>Publication Description</em> and <em>General Heading</em> information for each code you select.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="Alert">Important Note</span>: Selecting particular <em>Publication</em> or <em>Distribution</em> codes for your Profiles <strong>does not</strong> impact which records you will be exporting, only the contents of the <em>Publication</em> and/or <em>Distribution</em> fields you are sending.</p>
