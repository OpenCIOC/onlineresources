<p>The <em>Run Import</em> page performs the Add / Update record functions. This process can take a long time, especially with bilingual records. The start time is printed once importing has begun, and a &quot;.&quot; is printed as each record is successfully imported; once the import is complete, the completion time is printed. Once this process has completed, you should be sure to read the import report available from the main import menu. <span class="Alert">Please note that in some browsers, the ... progress bar does not appear until the import is finished. This does not mean that the import is not running successfully.</span></p>
<p><span class="Alert">Important Note</span>: if you are importing many records and the import fails to complete because it takes longer than the software allows, you can run the import again as many times as necessary to complete the process. The records that have successfully been imported will be moved to the <em>Completed</em> section after each run of the tool, and imports that did not complete will remain in the <em>Add</em> or <em>Update</em> sections.</p>
