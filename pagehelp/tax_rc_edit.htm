<p>Each Taxonomy Term can be associated with any number of <em>Related Concepts</em><em>. Related Concepts</em> are meant to represent or relate to a general theme. The Concept is an umbrella under which a number of Terms, often from different branches of the Taxonomy, can be clustered together under a general topic of interest or need. Examples of <em>Related Concepts</em> include: &quot;Blindness/Visual Impairments &quot;, &quot;Domestic Violence&quot;, and &quot;Homelessness&quot;. For more information about <em>Related Concepts</em> and other structures of the Taxonomy, you should use an official reference such as the library on <a href="http://www.211taxonomy.org">211taxonomy.org</a>.</p>
